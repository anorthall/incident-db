# Split Text Data
This data is OCR'd text from ACA Journals which has been split and cleaned by a human.

Files with the suffix `-NF` have not yet been formatted.

Files which have been formatted have had six dashes (`------`) added between in incident,
and the text has been cleaned up to remove any OCR errors or other content which may
confuse an LLM model when formatting and processing the text.

One important factor in communica-

can hear that is not necessary. The caver
who yells about flowstone while rappel-
ling needs education. But it is also impor-
tant not to signal when it is not necessary.
There is obviously some redundancy or
possible double interpretation of these
signals. Your buddy signals "2" - is he
going up, does he want you to come up,
or is he perhaps signalling to a third mem-
ber of your party? Circumstances should
tell you. You must be thinking, what is
happening?, what are my companions do-
ing?, and where are they relative to me?
It is also important to space the signal
series - if a series of three hoots is done
too fast, with little space between hoots,
in a resonant chamber this will sound like
one continuous sound.
Try it, it works; and its easy to remem-
ber: S-U-D-O.

ing a fatality from a 70 foot fall (March 28).
There were two dislocated shoulders (Janu-
ary 31 and October 2) from falls, and bro-
ken ribs/collapsed lung from a rappel (July
5-C). One fall jammed a caver into a tight
place (May 20), and a wooden ladder col-
lapsed yielding a broken leg (July 5-A). As
usual, belays or handlines undoubtedly
would have prevented some of these, but a
belayed fall still resulted in a dislocated
shoulder (January 31), and a fall holding a
handline yielded an injured shoulder (Oc-
tober 24).
d) Drowning - Two incidents, both
where a swimmer drowned in a sea cave
(January 4-B and February 21).
e) Equipment Problems - Twenty inci-
dents. There were three attempts to go
hand-over-hand in a pit (January 3, Spring-
A and May 23-25); the first two left some-
one trapped while the last produced a
heel-hang. There were the usual spelunker
light failures (April 29, July 4 and July 19)
and lack of sufficient light helped cavers
get lost (December 18). A wooden ladder
broke producing a broken leg (July 5-A). A
cave camp yielded a scalding when a ziploc
bag broke (March B) and a battery shorted
(April 6). On the vertical side, a harness
came apart (October 9), a scaling pole col-
lapsed without injury to the climber (July),
a locking carabiner was found to be
jammed open partway into a rappel (No-
vember-A), a caver descended a virgin pit
with 120 meters of rope without ascending
gear, luckily finding the pit to be 110 me-
ters (March-A), a rappeller clipped his rack
to his battery belt (July 18-A), and a fatality
occurred when a caver hanging for some
time in his harness died from compression
syndrome (November-C).
f) Flooding - None.
h) Hypothermia - Four examples, from
ordinary (January-A), to the more serious
where cavers became cold and exhausted
but still had a pool to swim across (June
13), beginner wetsuit cavers became cold
and tired (July 5-B) and a caver ascending
a waterfall pit got hung up (September 4).
Hypothermia is always potentially serious.
i) Illness - None.
1) Lost - Four. One may just be a light
failure (February 1-A). But there was con-
fusion amongst kids in a large group (Janu-
ary-B), a caver lost her way while returning
to camp in the cave alone (February 29) and
cavers in a large, complex cave took a
wrong turn (December 18).
r) Rockfall - Fifteen. Rockfall may be
the worst hazard in caving. It often seems
to occur spontaneously as in Jan 4-A, April

Loop Rebelays

1) Totally inert, with head in hyper-ex-
tension and legs hanging below heart level
(the most realistic for an unconscious vic-
tim).
2) With head upright, supported by a
brace. The legs dangled as in 1.
3) With feet in a footloop (of the Frog
system) that keeps the legs in a horizontal
position. The head is hyper-extended as in
1.
Viewing the video shows that an inert
victim in a typical Frog harness hangs with
the body horizontal, facing up, with the
head hanging back and down in "hyperex-
tension"; the legs hang down but really just
from the knees down.
All three produced "considerable diffi-
culties" after 12-13 minutes of hanging.
Despite the medical controls and monitor-
ing, one volunteer fainted. The other two
apparently were released before this could
occur.
The hyper-extension of the head was
described as very painful, leading to a
quicker faintness. A manual relief of the

belay, this is a misuse of equipment. As
with a cable ladder, which once were in
common use, the climber is not attached to
anything and must be belayed. It is also fair
to say that any such ladder is harder to use
than it may appear. I think any short drop
that needs to be rigged should be rigged
with a rope and each climber use ascenders
to get up.
3) Handlines Handlines are in quite com-
mon use. Typically they are used where the
climb or traverse is judged to be easy but
the exposure is significant. Many of these
are dangerous. For one thing, it is some-
times the case that climbers are relying on
simply holding on with their hands in case
of a fall. This may not be possible. Some-
times an ascender is slid along the line as
the climber moves along, with the result
that there may be significant slack which
could be a problem in a fall. Also, when
sliding the ascender the climber often must
use both hands.
Often a climber will clip into a horizontal
traverse handline with a carabiner attached
to his/her seat harness. This seems very
secure, but if the traverse is a long one, and
the line is fairly tight, a fall in the middle
of the traverse will produce vector forces
on the end anchors much greater than the
body weight times two or three generated
by the fall itself. The problem comes be-
cause cavers seem to judge a handline to
require less strength than a free-hanging pit

Bix - ill, dehydrated
On a Friday in October, 1991, Richard Walk
(37) and five companions did Ellison's Cave in
Georgia. This was part of the annual TAG Fall
"Cave-in," and at least one other group was in
the cave at the same time. They went in the
Fantastic Entrance, proceeded to Incredible Pit
and returned out Fantastic.
At the climb down to Incredible Pit, Walk
became lightheaded and suffered from blurred
vision. He was apparently suffering from a com-
bination of under-nourishment, a lack of sleep,
dehydration and fatigue. He drank some Ga-
toraid, ate lunch, including a Power Bar, and felt
better. Halfway back to Fantastic Pit he became
nauseated with blurred vision. From there out
he had a lot of trouble, but his friends were
patient and helped him by carrying some of his
gear. At the Balcony and Warmup Pits, he
would take 8-10 ascending steps and dry-heave.
He eventually made it out.

wife some 300 feet down the glacier.
It was still possible to see out a small opening.
The trapped cavers were able to free themselves

about 30 minutes to help each other squeeze

It was decided to try and let the joint relocate by

She was made as comfortable as possible lying

the joint was still dislocated. Another attempt
was made to manually relocate the joint without
success. Meanwhile a haul system had been set

her up. The shoulder was relieved and repaired

CAPSHAW CAVE,

February 1-A
Be - poor lights
On Saturday morning, February 1, four teen-
agers entered Capshaw Cave, a several-mile-
long cave underlying much of southeast
Cookville, Tennessee. They were Jeff Byrd,
Mike Dieringer, Asher Christianson and Bobby
Faulhaber. They were equipped with helmets,
some food and water, three flashlights and
backup candles; they intended to be out by 4
p.m. At about 3:30 they started out, but only one
light was working well by that time. When its
owner tripped and fell, it went out. They tried to
continue with dim lights but got turned around
and were truly lost. At about 10 p.m. they sat
down and waited for rescue.
When the boys failed to show up for supper,
one of the parents searched the neighborhood
and found Asher's car on South Maple Avenue,
next to an obscure entrance to the cave. The
authorities were called at about 6:30 p.m. At 7
p.m. a team entered and searched one main fork
of the cave. The cave is wet and contains numer-
ous drop offs so there was the possibility of
victims immobilized by hypothermia and/or in-
jury. A number of teams from other parts of the
state were put on standby for this contingency.
When the first team emerged unsuccessful, a
second was sent in to search the other major
fork. The four were found about 1-1/2 miles
from the entrance at about 1 a.m. Sunday. They
were cold and tired but otherwise in good con-
dition. They were escorted from the cave.

KING'S BOWL
SOUTH CAVE, IDAHO
March 28
AAc - caver fall
On Saturday, March 28, a group of six visited
the Crystal Ice Cave area of the Great Rift in
Idaho. These were five youths, of apparently
college age, and their leader Leland Sorenson,
the father of one of the youths. "The Great Rift
is a long discontinuous volcanic rift in southeast
Idaho that runs from Craters of the Moon Na-
tional Monument near Arco to its terminus in
the Wapi lava flow 65 miles to the south-south-
east. It is the longest and deepest such rift in the
U.S. and probably in the Western Hemisphere.
It has multiple openings into the earth as deep
as 300+ feet that occur as volcanic vents, spatter
cones, and fissures that date most recently to
2000 years BP."
Intent on sightseeing, they entered King's
Bowl, a large explosion crater about 450 by 150
and about 100 feet deep. Fissure caves lead from
both the north and south ends of the bottom of
the crater. They had a single lantern (it is not
clear if this is a gas or handheld electric) and
may have planned on visiting caves. Sorenson
apparently had visited these caves some years
before. In any case, they proceeded into King's
Bowl South Cave. These rifts are floored by
jagged lava rocks or ice and the going is slow.
Just beyond the twilight zone Sorenson, with the
lantern, stopped to let everyone catch up. Evan
Bates (19) went ahead, scrambling across large
breakdown blocks. About 200 feet from the
entrance he came to a 20-foot, 45 degree ice
slope leading to a 72 foot drop. Bates apparently
stepped onto this slope and fell.
In the dark he probably didn't realize what
was happening until it was over. In any case he
did not cry out. When the others reached the ice
slope they called but got no answer. Seeing
scrape marks in the dust on the slope, Sorenson
went back to his vehicle and fetched a rope.
With this he made his way down the slope to the
top of the drop. Seeing this, he retreated and
proceeded far enough down the road to be able
to call out on a two-way radio he had.
Aberdeen Fire Department and Power
County Rescue responded. Back at the ice slope,
it was discovered that Sorenson, from Special
Forces training 25 years previously, was the
only one with rappelling ability. When he rap-
pelled to the bottom of the drop he found himself
on an ice slope dropping north and had to strug-
gle mightily to reach the ledge where Bates had
come to rest, having been propelled out by the
momentum of his slide. Bates had a broken neck
as well as major head and facial injuries. He had
apparently died on impact. Sorenson called for
the Stokes litter but he was unable to get the
6-foot 1-inch, 195 pound Bates into it. Bates was
hoisted just enough by those above that he could
be lowered into the litter. The body was hauled
up, apparently by manpower only, followed by
the rescuer.

DIAMOND CAVE,

April 18
Ar - rock fall
On Saturday, April 18, a group of three, Jeff
Forbes, Elizabeth Earl and Linda Starr (43),
visited Diamond Cave in New Mexico. They
intended to survey, as part of the GYPKAP
Project. They were all experienced vertical cav-
ers and expected difficult conditions - pre-
vious survey crews had encountered waterfalls
over loose breakdown at downclimbs, rather
than the usual winding horizontal passage of
GYPKAP caves.
On this day the cave was without streams but
still wet and cold. They put hand lines on ex-
posed pitches and took up the survey where it
had ended, about 400 feet into the cave, just
short of a downclimb. After Forbes had checked
ahead for stations, they began. The second sta-
tion was at the top of this drop, on a slab 1.5
2 feet that was wedged in place by other rocks.

Cc caver fall
On a cold, snowy Saturday in the Spring,
several groups of cavers visited J-4 Cave in
Pennsylvania. The entrance to this cave is on a
quarry face, some 35-40 feet up. There are
ledges leading to the entrance and it is regarded
as easily climbable. The group in question was
a joint party with members of Loyalhanna
Grotto, Pittsburg Grotto and the Explorer's
Club of Pittsburg, some 14 in all. A Boy Scout
group preceded them and rigged a handline up
to the entrance culvert which this group used.
On the way out, however, the scouts had
exited and taken their handline, so the group had
to downclimb the face without it. They did have
some webbing and rigged some sort of etrier line
that climbers could clip into as they proceeded,
but this was painstaking and one caver declined
to clip in. This caver (female, about 25) got
down about 15 feet, at which point she slipped,
let go of the webbing and fell 25-30 feet to the
bottom of the face.
She suffered only a bruised tailbone, sprained
ankle and bruises. Apparently more serious in-
juries were prevented by the four to five inches
of snow on the ground, a tree partway down that
she hit, slowing her fall and directing her away
from a large tree, and the fact that she didn't
fight the fall but relaxed and took the tumble as
it came. She was able to walk to the vehicles
under her own power.

one light source. At one point he slipped and slid
into an opening too narrow to allow him to fall

his hips and ribs with his feet suspended above
the floor, a little below.
His companions went for help and firemen,
and others used hammer and chisel to free him.
He was stuck for some two hours.

On Sunday, May 24, a group of six Buffalo

20-foot waterfall. Three of the cavers, Brian
Stone (31), Rick Shaw and Larry Gray, were on
a ledge about 30 feet above the falls and were
able to climb down until they were in essence
alongside it. The other three made their way
around and down to the base of the falls. Sud-
denly the ledge under Brian Stone collapsed and
he fell 20 feet, landing in shallow water just
below the falls, landing on all four limbs with
his head hitting the floor as well.
He was in pain and unable to move himself
out of the water, but companions were right
there to aid him to a position on the bank. His
ankle and wrist were in pain, so they loosened
the shoe and splinted the wrist. He was some-
what shaken and starting to get cold from the
wet conditions and the shock of the accident.
They decided he could move on his own, so they
made their way up the narrow climbs to the
entrance. The victim was able to proceed under
his own power with the occasional push and/or
pull from a companion at a climb. They had a
rope but did not use it, arriving at the entrance
about 45 minutes later. He had suffered three
cracked bones in his foot and a severely sprained
wrist. His helmet surely spared him a potentially
fatal head injury.

Bs - stuck caver
In June a Boy Scout outing was hiking along
the C and o Canal and camped one night at
Killiansburg Cave. This cave and others in the
area are small. Some of the scouts visited Kil-
liansburg Cave and Brian Quintanilla (13) no-
ticed a passage that seemed to connect to a
second entrance. He couldn't get through from
that side, so he went around to the other entrance
and tried it that way. The passage was tight with
a plan view like an "L." Quintanilla endeavored
to enter the passage, but found he had to hyper-
extend his knees to get past the tight bend. He
pushed on regardless and when he popped
through, he was trapped - he could not con-
tinue and the move in reverse did not seem
possible.
His friends tried to help but could not, and the
victim became a little panicky. The scout leader,
Quintanilla's mother, was summoned and was
able to reach his feet, offering at least a little
comfort. She decided he might be able to get out
if he carefully duplicated his moves in reverse.
Upon questioning him, she found that he was in
the same position as when he had popped
through. They discussed the situation and with
the mother pulling on his pants and feet, and the
victim enduring the pain of forced hyperexten-
sion of his knees, Quintanilla was dragged back
through the constriction. Once free he thrashed
his way past his savior, in a panic, to get out of
the cave.

MCFAILS CAVE,
NEW YORK
July 5-B
Bhx - exhaustion
At about noon on Sunday, July 5, a group of
four cavers visited McFails Cave In New York.
They were Art Rafferty, Jane Prendergast,
Harry Brandle and Jason Brandle (14). They
were all wearing wetsuits and each had their
own vertical rig. They intended to reach the
Northwest Junction, and the Ack's Shack En-
trance drop was rigged in case they wanted a
quick way out.
They entered the Coeyman's Dome En-
trance, finding the waterfall to be negligible.
The midpit was comparable to a heavy rain.
Apparently they stored their vertical gear here,
as the remaining drops are short and were rigged
with etriers. They did 8- and 12-foot drops via
these etriers and did one upclimb to view forma-
tions. At about 5:30 p.m. they started out.
It soon became apparent that Jason was tired.
They managed the two etrier climbs and pro-
ceeded to the entrance drop. Jason was now very
tired and needed encouragement to put on his
frog rig. Harry Brandle explained how to attach
it to the rope and proceeded up. Jason tried to
go next, but his seat ascender had been attached
to his chest harness, and when he tried to ascend
it was immediately apparent that something was
wrong. He got off rope and they checked the rig.
Those at the bottom didn't know any better,
so he tried again with the same results. Harry
Brandle was unable to descend to see what was
wrong, since in the process of repacking gear so
that he was taking most of Jason's, his rack
remained at the bottom. Rafferty tried rigging
his rope walker on Jason, but he only got seven
feet up before deciding he didn't like the way it
was working. Rafferty managed to talk him
back down, and they decided to send Prender-
gast up with Harry's rack so he could descend
and get things straight. Meanwhile she would go
and call for assistance, as Jason had now become
nauseated and was starting to look as though he
would not be able to make it up on his own.

HURT TREE PIT,
ALABAMA
July 18-A
De - rappel gear
On Saturday, July 18, a group of six cavers
visited Hurt Tree Pit, a cave in William's Cove
in Jackson County, Alabama. The cave entrance
is a 166-foot fault-developed pit with several
ledges and boulder slopes, requiring at least two
re-belays. At the bottom a canyon traverse over
50 feet of exposure leads to a 54-foot drop.
Down this, water flow is encountered and fol-
lowed through a belly crawl for 150 feet to an
81-foot, wet pit. Beyond this, they intended to
push a lead that required a short leader climb.
Three cavers proceeded down these drops to
start the climb. At the 81-foot pit, Deepak Cho-
pra (20) applied his six-bar rack to the rope and
backed over the lip. On rappel, things felt funny
so he looked at his seat harness. Whoa! His rack
was clipped into the belt of his battery pack, not
his seat harness! He quickly engaged a safety
un-
ascender to the rope above the rack, unloaded
the rack, and switched its attachment to his seat
harness. He was then able to unload the ascender
and continue the rappel.
Reference: Andy Porter NSS Accident Report
undated, 2 pages.
Comments: The battery belt was one inch tu-
bular nylon webbing, but the buckle was a slid-
ing type with teeth that grip the webbing and
reportedly not very strong. Luckily the victim
weighed only 120 pounds. The victim was rela-
tively experienced but had complained of fa-
tigue on the hike to the cave, and this may have
been the reason he rigged his rack wrong. Check
your 'biner!

then rigged but the stranded cavers were on the

On Sunday, July 26, two cavers entered Fat

Alaska. It had been raining for two days. The
cave entrance is an insurgence and flow was
high. They managed to avoid most of the water
while surveying. About 150 feet into the cave,
one of the cavers noticed an occasional pebble
or rock falling from the slope next to him. Just
after setting a survey station on the face of a six-
to eight-foot high bank of unsorted fill, the
entire bank collapsed, cascading into the spa-
cious passage, narrowly missing both cavers.

LOST WORLD CAVE,
WEST VIRGINIA
August 22
Dr - log fall
On Saturday, August 22, a group of cavers
visited Grapevine Pit, an entrance to Lost
World, a commercial cave in Greenbriar
County, West Virginia. This is a 120-foot free
drop that is cemented over at the top, leaving a
15-inch-square hole with a gate. Under the ce-
ment is a jam of rotting logs; several years ago
they had cleaned this by knocking down all the
logs they could reach.
George Dasher was ascending in a rope-
walker and reached the hole at the top. He
reached out a foot to get a hold and struggled a
bit, trying to get through the small opening.
When his foot touched one of the logs, it fell.
He yelled "Rock!" twice, watching the log
spinning end-over-end into the darkness.
Susanna Clark was below, giving tension on the
rope, and she dashed down the tour stairs off one
side at the bottom. The ten foot by four to five
inch log struck and damaged the 2 X 4 guardrail
of a tour platform but missed Clark.

October 9
Be - vertical problem
On the morning of Friday, October 9, a group
of 12 cavers visited Mystery hole in Tennessee,
with a 290-foot entrance shaft. This was a trip
of the annual TAG "Cavein." A waterfall and
the size of the pit, widening to 100 feet across
at the bottom, makes for poor communications.
They had two ropes of 300+ feet, so they rigged
both the original and the newer waterfall-zone
site. A dam and plug allows one to eliminate the
waterfall until the reservoir fills up. This time
was estimated to be about 45 minutes.
They put in the plug and rappelled in. After
some exploration and lunch they started out, two
tandem teams at a time, one on each rope. The
plug had been removed after they had com-
pleted their rappels, and was apparently re-
placed just before a crew started up. Thus the
wet rope team had 45 minutes to make it. Two
cavers from Arkansas, Chuck and Carol, were
one team, with Chuck in the lead, but when
Carol got about halfway up the harness of the
foot Gibbs of her ropewalker rig came loose.
She had problems getting it retied, so Kerry
Rowland, last on the other rope, backed his
ascenders down to help her. By the time he got
there, she had fixed it with a section of shoelace
and started climbing again. Within five steps her
knee Gibbs came loose, but she was still sup-
ported by a chest ascender and the tied up foot
Gibbs. Rowland told her to hold still, and did a
pendulum to her rope and clipped onto it. He
fixed the knee unit and gave her his backup foot
ascender with a good harness. She continued,
and was helped over the lip by Chuck, who had
transferred to the tail of the rope, hanging just
over the lip.

AAe - ascending rig
In late November, four cavers entered Ban-
shee Hole in Tennessee. They descended the
95-foot entrance drop and apparently did some
exploring. The first caver to try to exit was
apparently the least experienced and started up
the entrance pit rope using a system like that
illustrated in the flyer that used to accompany a
new pair of Jumar ascenders - two ascenders,
each tied to a foot with different length slings to
each foot and a chest harness of webbing with a
carabiner hooked to it in front. The rope being
climbed passed through the 'biner to hold the
caver upright. There was no seat harness.
The caver did alright until he got to a lip about
eight to ten feet down from the top. This he was
unable to pass and became exhausted. His com-
panions, more experienced, were able to ascend
to him and struggled for some three hours to
either get him over the lip or back down, to no
avail. At that point, they reinforced the chest
harness with more webbing and one of them
went for help. The Cumberland County Rescue
Squad responded and reached the victim within
40 minutes being called. When the victim was
released from the chest harness he went into
cardiac arrest and died.

the large debris cone at the bottom of the cenote.
The line they were looking for was vertical, and
they came to realize that this was a different one.
It ended at 130 feet, tied off to a large log at the
edge of the debris cone. Agreeing with hand
signals to search there, Milhollin tied off the
search line to the exit line and proceeded.
They passed through a low wall opening with
a smooth ceiling into a slightly vaulted passage.
As he entered this, it turned right to parallel the
main room of the cenote, and the line had to be
placed against the ceiling. As he moved along,

using more bars, not fewer (remember, he first
tried to rig in with three). Using four bars might
have been all right, but Moore's rack had
spacers between the first two openings; the
amount of friction these openings can give is
thus limited. If the fourth bar was pushed or
dropped down the rack, there might suddenly
be insufficient friction. This is probably what
happened. Moore reached the bottom with
four bars rigged.
One report (1) is that the rack was home-
made out of chrome-moly with the bend at the
top poorly done by hand. The bars were
stamped steel with spacers made of thin copper
tubing. At the bottom the spacers were report-
edly found to be jammed into the holes in the
bars and the bars were fully jammed up to the
top of the rack. The rack was also bent. The
speculation made was that while descending
the spacers failed and allowed the bars to come
together, allowing the rappel to go out of con-
trol. This doesn't make sense if the bars
come together, there is more friction and more
control; furthermore he was not descending
when he lost control. If the spacers were
jammed into the bars and the rack bent, I would
guess that this happened when Moore hit the
bulge near the bottom.
One other thing is apparent Moore
fought to get control. He apparently was able
to get the rope looped across his body, perhaps
like the old body rappels. Unfortunately he had
gained too much speed. The body was found
with a six inch deep groove cut up into the

Florida. One was a hard-core caver from Aus-
tralia, with a little cave-diving experience, but
he had not completed full cave certification.
This was reportedly to be his last dive before
leaving the country. His equipment, borrowed,
included twin-mounted 104s with independent
K-valves. He reportedly had never dived this
cave before nor had he dived with his partner
before. His partner was himself not very famil-
iar with the cave.
They reportedly headed for Alfred's Room,
diving on air. At some point, when the Austra-
lian went to switch to this second tank, he had a
malfunction of some kind and was forced to
continue with the first tank, which was very low
on air. Shortly after he signalled 'out of air" to
his buddy and they attempted to share air using
the buddy's long hose.
They then experienced trouble controlling
buoyancy-the Australian was very negative,
so his partner tried to compensate by increasing
his buoyancy. At some point the Australian let
go of his partner, or of the hose he was sharing,
and descended, plowing into the thick silt on the
floor. His partner shot upwards. the silt boiled
up and they were separated, in zero visibility.
The partner was by now also low on air and
elected to exit rather than attempt a search.
Recovery divers found the Australian, only a
couple of hundred feet from the entrance. One
tank was empty, the other had considerable air
left.

Comments: Editor H. V. Grey writes: "Air
planning and management for independent
tanks is considerably more complicated than for
a dual-valve system, and it greatly increases task
loading. For these reasons, it is mostly discour-
aged for novices. Maintaining the recom-
mended tank-pressure balances in conformance
with the thirds rule would have gone a long way
toward preventing this fatality.
Clearly, unfamiliarity with the borrowed
equipment, and resultant lack of buoyancy con-
trol in a cave system with a terribly silty floor,
also greatly complicated the air-sharing on the
way out. Though it is easy to sympathize with a
visitor's desire to get in as much cave diving as
possible on a potentially once-in-a-lifetime trip,
this, unfortunately, does not render the advice
to build up experience slowly and conserva-
tively any the less sound."

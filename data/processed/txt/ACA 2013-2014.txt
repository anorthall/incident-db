From the ACA Editor
"Prepare for the unknown by studying how others in the past
have coped with the unforeseeable and the unpredictable.
General George S. Patton
General George S. Patton is one of the most celebrated military
commanders in history and was a natural leader of men. He demanded
rigid discipline in his troops, requiring them to wear their helmets at all
times and to be prepared for the unknown. I think General Patton would
have made an excellent cave-rescue instructor.
American Caving Accidents is more than the journal of record for
caving accidents in North America; it is an educational resource provid-
ing insight into what can go wrong on a cave trip and why. By its very
definition, an accident is unpredictable. But studying how others have
handled unpredictable events can help us to be better prepared when
faced with similar situations. When an accident happens, an important
decision must be made to self rescue or call for help. This issue is filled
with excellent examples of both large-scale callout rescues and small
party assisted rescues that were handled competently and efficiently.
Understanding what is involved in a cave rescue should also provide a
little more impetus for cavers to work to avoid accidents in the first place.
The incident of a caver fall in Ellisons Cave was a complicated rescue
of a severely injured caver from a vertical cave with multiple long drops.
The success of the rescue was due to the combination of several factors.
The quick actions of the patient's teammates likely saved his life by control-
ling his severe bleeding, and the rescuers who responded were capable
and proficient due to years of commitment to practice and training in
cave-rescue techniques. It is now a common joke among cavers to say
that if you ever need to be rescued from a cave, "you better hope you
are in TAG." While this is a great testament to the cave-rescue teams in
TAG (the cave-rich area where Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia meet),
it should also be a motivation for cavers in other parts of the country to
train with their local rescue agencies to encourage preparedness and
rescue-readiness for caving emergencies. When rescue agencies are not
familiar with or equipped to handle cave rescues, patient care can be
prolonged unnecessarily. The Weybridge Cave incident is an example of
this. Fortunately, following that incident, local agencies acknowledged the
need for cave-rescue training and participated in a cave-rescue training
seminar along with the local cavers.
Also in this issue are several reports of injured cavers being rescued
by members of their own groups. These small party assisted rescues are
often referred to as SPARs. The 23 May, 2013, and the 12 April, 2014,
incidents in Virginia are two examples of well-executed SPARs. In other
rescues, such as those at Iron Hoop and Lechuguilla Cave, patients were
aided greatly by their own caving team until outside help arrived.
One thing several of these rescues have in common is that many of
the cavers involved had previously taken one or more cave-rescue training
courses through the National Cave Rescue Commission (NCRC) of the NSS.
The NCRC is not a cave rescue group itself; rather it "provides training and
development opportunities for persons and organizations engaged in cave
rescue activities." To date the NCRC has offered more than 300 seminars
and trained more than 6,500 people. That is an amazing number of people
who have made a commitment to themselves and their teammates to
be more prepared for the unpredictable. As the NCRC continues to offer
more weekend and week-long trainings, we can expect to see even more
cavers learning basic cave-rescue skills and those already with training
continuing to learn ever more advanced skills.
As you read the following reports, | challenge you to ask yourself
how you would have responded to the incidents if you had been involved.
Would you have had the necessary gear? Would you have known how to
use it? If you have difficulty answering those questions, please consider
participating in a cave-rescue training (many of them are free or very
inexpensive). If you feel confident that you could respond appropriately,
consider getting involved in teaching new cavers the basics of cave rescue.
Accidents will happen, but with a little education, preparation, and cave-
rescue skills practice, we can make good choices and take appropriate
actions to achieve the best possible outcomes.

Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the many individuals who submitted reports to
ACA. These reports often involved several follow-up e-mails and phone
conversations. Your time and contributions are what make ACA a valu-
able resource for cavers. In addition, several cavers assisted in providing
additional information during the research of incidents including Dave
Riggs, Ben Miller, Geary Schindel, Art Palmer, Brad Tipton, Michael Patton,
Marty Abercrombie, Jack Speece, Greg Brick, and Ronald Stefan Stewart.
John Adsit, Sarah Truebe, and Scott McCrea researched several incidents
and spent a considerable amount of time conducting interviews and writ-
ing incident reports.
I am grateful to the ACA Review Committee: Andy Armstrong, Richard
Breisch, Scott Christenson, George Dasher, Yvonne Droms, Mark Minton,
Stephen Mosberg, Rene Ohms, Sarah Richards, and Forrest Wilson, who
so enthusiastically lent their time and expertise to this publication. This
publication is truly a collaborative effort.
And finally, I would like to thank Roger Mortimer and Tony Canike for
providing feature articles for this issue and Dave Bunnell, Curt Harler, and
Wm Shrewsbury for assistance in bringing this issue to print.
The National Cave Rescue Commission
www.caves.org/io/ncro
The National Cave Rescue Commission (NCRC) received its charter
from the National Speleological Society in 1979, and serves as the
Society's representative on issues of cave rescue training and opera-
tions. It is a volunteer group developed primarily to train and track
cave rescue resources throughout the United States.
The NCRC does not perform cave rescues. It organizes, develops,
and provides training in cave rescue techniques, maintains list of indi-
viduals trained in cave rescue, and can help locate rescue resources in
times of need. Most NCRC-trained cavers do participate in rescues, but
not as part of the NCRC. They work as members of their local rescue
teams, civil defense units, or cave rescue groups.
The NCRC sponsors a week-long Cave Rescue Operations and
Management Seminar each year that is held in various locations around
the United States. The seminar serves as a "boot camp" of cave rescue
and provides three levels of training. Cave rescue is constantly evolv-
ing, and the most up-to-date techniques are presented each year. In
addition to the annual week-long seminar, the NCRC regions sponsor
regional week-long seminars, regional modular seminars (taught over a
series of weekends), courses in small-group and self-rescue techniques,
and weekend cave rescue orientation courses.
Information on NCRC operation, activities, and training is avail-
able on the NCRC website at www.ncrc.info. Upcoming seminars are
announced on the website and in the NSS News.

Descriptions of Incident Results and Types
American Caving Accidents (ACA) is a special publication of the
National Speleological Society (NSS). Since 1967, ACA has served as the
journal of record for caving accidents in North America. The purpose of
collecting and reporting caving accidents and incidents is to help cavers
educate themselves on the hazards of caving based on real-life incidents.
These incidents, when reported accurately and in detail, should ultimately
help readers become safer cavers by learning through others' experiences.
Reports are collected through submissions by cavers involved in
the incident or rescue or by those who otherwise have some credible
knowledge of the event. Caving incidents brought to the attention of ACA
by media reports are verified for accuracy by contacting involved parties
directly when possible.
As with previous issues, caving reports have been divided into two
categories: regular caving and cave diving. These categories are further
classified by incident result or outcome, and incident type (causes and
contributing factors).
Some reported incidents are placed in a separate category called
"caving-related." These include incidents in which a person needed rescu-
ing from a cave that they did not intend to enter, incidents that occur on
the way to or from a cave, incidents involving animals needing rescue
from a cave, or other unusual circumstances. Because these incidents
did not occur during normal caving activities but required caving gear,
cave-rescue techniques, or cavers to effect a rescue, they are considered
caving-related. Caving-related incidents are not included in the statistics.
DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT RESULTS
Fatalities-Fatalities from caving are relatively uncommon and average
about three per year. Although fatalities tend to occur with inexperienced,
ill-equipped persons, experienced cavers are not exempt.
Injury vs. No Injury-An injury is physical damage or harm inflicted on
a person, usually by an external force. Examples include wounds, frac-
tures, contusions, burns, and frostbite. Heart trouble, allergic reactions,
migraines, and other conditions are not considered injuries and are
categorized as an illness/medical issue incident type.
Aid vs. No Aid-For the purposes of this publication, aid is considered
rendered in the following cases: if one or more persons needed the help
of others outside of those in their caving party to exit the cave, if outside
or additional assistance was requested, or if an ambulance or Life Flight
was used to transport the patient to a medical facility.
DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT TYPES
Acetylene-related-Acetylene-related incidents were more common in the
1960s and 1970s than during the last few decades. No acetylene-related
incidents have been reported since 1996, probably because bright yet
relatively inexpensive LED lights are now favored among the majority of
American cavers. This issue contains one previously unreported acetylene-
related incident from 1995.
Bad Air-There were no incidents due to bad air reported for this issue,
although one person who built a fire while stranded in an artificial cave
had to be treated for carbon monoxide poisoning. In past reports, the pres-
ence of bad air in caves has been due to biological decomposition, poor
air exchange, carbon monoxide from fires, blasting fumes, or chemicals
being washed into the cave.
Caver Fall-Caver falls continue to constitute a large proportion of caving
accidents. For simplicity, any fall by any person in a cave, regardless of
their experience, is considered a caver fall. This includes the report of a
three-year-old child who fell on a commercial tour of Jewel Cave (SD). In
this issue, there are 22 reports of people falling while on a caving trip,
and five of people accidentally falling into a pit or cave. With only one
exception, all of the falls resulted in injury or a fatality.
Difficulty on Rope or Ladder-The category of difficulty on rope or ladder
was added to ACA in 1994 to encompass a variety of problems that may
prevent a caver from being unable to ascend or descend a rope or ladder.
This issue contains a report of a youth who could not climb a cable ladder
and another of a person having difficulty ascending out of War Eagle Cave
(AL). A third report from Alcove Pit (NM) resulted in a fatality.
Drowning-There were two drowning incidents in 2014-one in Guam
and the other in Hawai'i. Both incidents involved noncavers visiting caves
that were popularized on the Internet.
Equipment Problem-In previous issues, this catch-all category has
included rigging, light, and rope failures; slipping ascenders, and misuse
or lack of equipment. Four equipment problem incidents are reported
here; one involves a caving harness with three straps not doubled back,
and another involves an anchor failure on a deviation. A third incident
occurred when a caver with muddy ascending gear could not ascend a
rope. In the fourth incident, a caver rerigged a rope incorrectly, resulting
in a 20-foot fall. There are also two incidents included in the previously
unreported section. One involves a rope ladder with faulty rigging; the
other involves a defective O-ring on a cave diver's regulator.
Exhaustion-Only the Scroll Cave (AZ) incident is attributed mainly to
exhaustion, although dehydration was also likely a key factor (compare
this to the Lechuguilla Cave (NM) incident). In other incidents-Serendipity
Pit (TN), Big Bertha Cave (KY), and Pettijohn Cave (GA) 2014, exhaustion
was likely a contributing factor.
Flooding-Cavers were able to escape a flooding entrance crawl through a
skylight in County Line Cave (NM) in 2014. The only other flooding incident
reported is from 1963 when Scouts were rescued from Nickajack Cave(TN).
Hypothermia-Hypothermia is often a secondary result in caving incidents,
often resulting from a caver being stuck, injured, or stranded in a cave.
It is especially dangerous not only because of the physiological aspects,
but because it impairs judgment, which can lead to mistakes and other
accidents. No incidents are listed with hypothermia as the primary factor.
Illness/Medical Issue-There are three incidents of persons becoming
ill during caving trips. One caver experienced chest pains that required
medical attention and another died from a heart attack in the Binkley
Cave System (IN). A caver in Lechuguilla Cave (NM) became extremely
dehydrated and required intravenous fluids. One cave diving fatality is
attributed to a medical issue, and a caving-related incident reports a
medical problem while canoeing to a littoral cave.
Lost-Out-of-state cavers became lost while trying to negotiate a through
trip in the Bone-Norman Cave System (WV). Luckily they had a surface
watch who reported them missing, and cavers found them the next day.
In another report, a caver became separated from her group in Run to
the Mill Cave (TN). After pulling up all their ropes and exiting the cave,
her group noticed that she was missing. They reentered the cave and
eventually found her.
Lost Control on Rappel-This incident-type category was added in 2011
to cover incidents of persons losing control while on rappel. In previous
issues, these incidents were listed under Caver Falls or Difficulty on Rope.
While most out-of-control rappels also result in a caver fall, the contrib-

---------- Page 6 ----------
uting factor or cause is very different than those typical for caver falls.
In 2013, a caver at Valdina Farms Sinkhole (TX) was rappelling with
a heavy load of video equipment. He was able to avoid a free fall but
sustained severe rope burns to his hands. An out-of-control rappel in
Missouri in 2009 resulted in severe damage to one caver's foot and heel
that has required numerous surgeries to repair.
Rock fall-Five incidents from rock fall are reported in this issue. Two
incidents involved cavers who were on rope and resulted in significant
injuries. Rock fall in Warrens Cave (FL) and Happy Top Horror Hole (TN)
resulted in no injury. In the final incident, a caver was struck in the mouth
by a falling rock in Fulford Cave (CO).
Stuck-Two people required aid when they became stuck in tight cave
passages in 2014. Both persons were inexperienced and not associated
with any caving groups.
Trapped or Stranded-This category describes incidents in which the caver
or cavers are prevented from exiting the cave. There are 11 incidents
reported of this type. Reasons include being trapped by a dislodged
boulder (two incidents), encountering an obstacle (ice plug, high water
levels) partway during a pull-down through trip, running out of light (two
incidents), not being able to ascend back up a rope (two incidents), not
being able to free-climb out of a small pit (two incidents), and not want-
ing to cross a stream to exit. Except for the trapped cavers in Raspberry
Cave (AZ), all of these incidents required aid.

other categories. Examples in this issue include cavers that were overdue
from a survey trip in Serendipity Pit (TN), an injury from a finger being
caught between webbing and rock, and a reoccurring knee problem during
a mock rescue in Idaho.
Cave Diving Accidents and Incidents-Six cave diving accidents reported
in 2013 resulted in two injuries and six fatalities. Three fatalities, including
a father and son diving on Christmas day, were due to divers running out
of air. Two divers used wrong gas mixtures; one died and one survived. A
Missouri man died from a medical issue while cave diving in Mexico. In
the final fatal incident, a cave diver may have had an equipment problem.
His dive partner required decompression in a hyperbaric chamber after
attempting to rescue him.
Only 2 incidents and no fatalities were reported in 2014. This is only
the second year since 1986 that no cave-diving fatalities were reported. A
cave diver in New Mexico had difficulty exiting a spring due to a constric-
tion at the entrance and the presence of bad air. A diver in Florida took
a wrong turn while exiting the cave and found himself in a silted-out and
tight passage. His partner went for help, but the partner and a rescuer
returned to find the diver making his way out of the cave with a spare
tank he had found in the cave.
Two previously-unreported diving accidents are included. In one, in
woman died of an unknown cause after being found unresponsive
a shallow water. The other incident involves faulty equipment, but the diver
was successfully assisted by her partner.

********** 6 January
Serendipity Pit, Tennessee
other (overdue), aid, no injury
The Chattanooga Hamilton County Rescue Service (CHCRS) was
notified that a group of four cavers, who had been in Serendipity Pit for
more than 30 hours, missed their out time. As CHCRS prepared to enter
the cave, a member of the overdue group exited the cave and informed
them that everyone was all right. Four hours later, however, a second
caver exited alone and expressed concern for the two cavers still in the
cave. Cumberland County authorities were notified and requested the
assistance of CHCRS.
Interviews of the two cavers who had exited revealed that the team
had been pushing a "very grim lead deep in the cave." They estimated their
travel time out of the cave from their turn-around spot to be about 10
hours, including a long, grim crawl and a pit series beyond two J-rappels.
The CHCRS team found the two cavers at about 5:00 a.m. on the far
side of the J-rappels. They offered some assistance with the rebelays, but
the cavers were otherwise moving slowly under their own power. With
assistance from the Crossville Fire Department, one caver was hauled up
the 49-foot entrance pit. The last caver exited at 9:30 a.m., after 41 hours
in the cave. Paramedics determined that the cavers were dehydrated and
exhausted but otherwise unhurt.
1. Brad Tipton, e-mail communication, 9 January 2013.
Comments: One of the first rules of caving is to always tell someone
where you are going and when to expect your return. If cavers miss their
"out time," the person acting as surface watch should call the local authori-
ties immediately. Although the cavers in this incident probably would have
made it out on their own eventually, initiating a quick response was the
appropriate thing to do.


********** 23 February
Crownover Saltpeter Cave, Tennessee
caver fall, injury and aid
Seventeen students from the Georgia Institute of Technology were
visiting Crownover Saltpeter Cave when Steven Touchton (21) slipped and
fell about 40 feet. While the other students had traversed a narrow canyon
via a lower route, Touchton had remained high, stemming across on slop-
ing ledges. His injuries included a fractured pelvis and wrist, compression
fractures to several vertebrae, and multiple fractures to his clavicle.
Several agencies responded but determined the rescue to be too
technical for their personnel. Chattanooga Hamilton County Rescue
Service (CHCRS) was contacted to respond. CHCRS packaged the patient in
an Oregon Spine Splint (OSS) and a SKED litter. They used a mechanical-
advantage haul system to first raise him out of the canyon. They then
converted the haul system to a lowering system to lower him into an
adjacent room. The patient was then hauled up another 30-foot pit, where
an evacuation team carried him through walking and stooping passage
to the surface. He was airlifted to Erlanger Hospital in Chattanooga and
treated for his injuries.

rescue from Franklin County cave," www.tfponline.com, 25 February 2013.
3. Brad Tipton, Incident Report, 25 March 2013.
Comments: This rescue, which was deemed too technical by some
responding agencies, was accomplished in a little over an hour by CHCRS.
Cavers and teams experienced in cave rescues should establish good
working relations with other local rescue teams and invite them to cave-
rescue trainings when possible.


********** 23 February
Bone-Norman Cave System, West Virginia
lost, aid, no injury
Two novice cavers (both in their 20s) from New Jersey entered the
Bone-Norman Cave System on a Friday morning intending to complete a
through-trip from the Bone Entrance to the Norman Entrance. They trav-
eled through the Devil's Pinch and the following maze section but stopped
at the waterfall in Norman. The two cavers did not know how to climb
up or bypass the waterfall, so they turned around to retrace their steps.
Along the way, they became lost. When they had not returned home by
Saturday morning, Greenbrier County 911 was alerted. The Renick Fire
Department responded and called local caver John Pearson, who spread
the word through the caving community.
Search teams were sent in from both entrances. The missing cavers
were eventually located around 7:00 p.m. Saturday evening by Michael
and Brandon Vance. The Vance brothers led the two cavers back through
Bone Cave and exited the cave. The search team that entered from the
Norman side was not given a time to report back. They continued search-
ing for many hours and exited the cave at 3:00 a.m. on Sunday morning,
several hours after the rescue had concluded.
1. David and Mary Sue Socky (eds.), Grotto Trip Log, Carbide Dump, April
2013, 48(4).
2. Ed Saugstad, e-mail communication, 22 April 2013.
Comments: Establishing a time to report back may have saved the
Norman-side search team the extra effort. Incident command responsibly
left someone at the entrance to make sure they exited safely.


********** 23 March
Foxhole Cave, Tennessee
caver fall, injury and aid
On 23 March, a small group toured Foxhole Cave as customers of a
company that leads wild cave tours. During their tour, the group negotiated
a traverse on a narrow ledge around a 40-foot-deep pit. A traverse line
was provided, but the group did not have harnesses or other equipment
to clip into the line. While making her way along the ledge, using the rope
as a handline, a 41-year-old woman slipped and fell into the pit. Most of
this 40-foot fall is a freefall. She landed among jagged breakdown directly
below a constant drip of water. She fractured her pelvis, a rib, and several
vertebrae, was unable to move from her position, and was quickly soaked
in cold water. No vertical equipment was available to reach her, so the
guide exited the cave to call for help.
Chattanooga Hamilton County Rescue Service (CHCRS) responded
and sent teams to reach and stabilize the patient and to begin rigging for
the patient's extraction. The first rescuers to reach the patient found her
to be in severe pain and suffering from exposure. She was given fluids
and an IV and was packaged in a full-body vacuum splint. Brad Tipton,
Lieutenant for the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Cave/Cliff Rescue Unit,
explained how the patient was removed from the pit: "Once the Ferno
arrived, they packaged for a vertical haul due to the keyhole-shaped,
body-sized hole we were forced to haul through. The pit was bisected by
breakdown wedged between the walls. This provided us with an oppor-
tunity to get edge tenders and manpower in good positions for the haul.
Unfortunately, there wasn't a single natural anchor anywhere in the cave
2013 Caving Accidents and Incidents

---------- Page 11 ----------
to use for hauling. We set two bolts in the ceiling at the edge of the pit
for high help and two more 50 feet back in the ceiling for the anchor for
the haul and belay. In the meantime, we needed a redirect 25 feet out
in the middle of the pit due to the boulder choke halfway down the pit.
The boulder choke problem was solved by wedging Jeff [Bartlett] above
the keyhole with a pulley rigged to his harness. Jeff was able to sustain
the force of the redirect, which saved us at least an hour of bolting and
rigging. [Other rescuers] were then able to use the boulder choke to
position themselves to receive the patient as she reached Jeff's redirect.
This worked to perfection."
Rescuers then began to move the patient toward the entrance. More
bolts were placed to lower the patient down a 15-foot drop where she
was received by a fresh team of rescuers. At the entrance, a determina-
tion was made that hauling the patient out of the 100-foot-deep sinkhole
would be safer than rescuers trying to carry her up the steep slope. Due
to inclement weather, air evacuation was not an option, so the patient
was transported to Erlanger Hospital by ambulance.

3. "Knox Co. team called to assist in 7 hour cave rescue," www.wbir.com,
25 March 2013.
Comments: Cave rescuers often comment that horizontal caves
become vertical caves during a rescue. Many free-climbable slopes and
pits become vertical hauls and lowers for an incapacitated patient. In
some cases, such as this incident, horizontal caving takes us into the fall
zone of vertical pits, but few of us take the extra step of keeping rope and
vertical gear in the vehicle when going on a horizontal cave trip. In this
incident, the lack of vertical gear prevented access to the injured patient
for more than three hours. When planning for emergencies, consider all
possible accidents, including falling down a pit in a horizontal cave. Don't
think only of gear that you carry with you in the cave, but also consider
essential rescue gear that could be retrieved from your vehicle.


********** 23 March
Iron Hoop Cave, Alabama
caver fall, injury and aid
Eight cavers entered Iron Hoop Cave for a day of exploration and
photography. Three cavers stopped to take photographs while the other
five traveled further into the cave. While traversing a narrow passage
above a stream, Jim Gerwer (51) reached for a handhold that broke free.
Gerwer fell 5 feet into the stream, landing on his back and fracturing
several lumbar vertebrae in the process.
Bil and Sherry Davis witnessed the fall and hurried down to help
him. Although Gerwer was in a great deal of pain, he showed no obvious
deformities, and he had normal vital signs. Gerwer wanted badly to begin
moving toward the entrance, but the nature of his injuries prevented
him from doing so. While Sherry Davis and Jim Corey stayed with the
patient, Bil Davis and Stephanie Schleis left to inform the other cavers
and summon help.
To get a cell phone signal, Bil and Schleis had to drive about six miles.
Once Jackson County 911 was notified of the situation, Schleis remained at
the local volunteer fire station to guide the first responders to the scene.
Meanwhile, Bil returned to the cave to get updates for the first responders
and to provide additional Mylar blankets and candles for heat if needed.
Two hours had now passed since the accident.
After delivering supplies and getting a patient update, Bil and Sherry
exited the cave, leaving Corey and Matt Blake to care for Gerwer. Upon exit-
ing, Sherry maintained an entrance log until she was relieved by Jackson
County Fire and Rescue (JCFR). JCFR was given updates on the patient's
condition and location along with estimates of what would be needed
2013 Caving Accidents and Incidents
to evacuate the patient. Bil, Alicia Nelson, and a member of JCFR, carried
supplies to Gerwer, flagging the route as they went. Gerwer was packaged
in
a SKED litter to be carried out of the cave. Other than a belay on a few
slopes and a haul system at the entrance, no other technical rigging was
required. At the entrance, the rescuers realized that the SKED® would
not fit through a constriction, so the patient was hauled up in his harness.
1. Bil Davis, Incident Report, 6 April 2013.
2. Brad Tipton, Facebook post, 24 March 2013.
Comments: Gerwer's companions did an excellent job of assisting
the rescue teams in this operation. Maintaining an entrance log, flagging
a route to the patient, and running information between the patient and
the surface support helped to make this rescue run efficiently. These
actions were extraordinary given the fact that the cavers and rescuers
were all the while facing the threat of the cave flooding. A local rainstorm
was causing the entrance crawls to fill with water, and local authorities
had to divert a surface stream in order to carry out the rescue operation.
This incident occurred while many local rescuers were responding to the
Foxhole Cave incident on the same day.


********** 5 April
Warrens Cave, Florida
rockfall, no injury, no aid
A group of cavers were working on a dig in Florida's longest dry
cave on a Friday afternoon. The passage in which they were digging is
described as "filled with thin, horizontal layers of fine sand, evidently
laid down by stream flow long, long ago. The ceiling is composed of a
layer of chert embedded within limestone." The purpose of the dig was
to try to bypass a tight squeeze, thus making travel to the back of the
cave quicker and easier.
During their activities, one caver was attempting to hammer a chunk
of chert "weighing a few tens of pounds" out of the ceiling when it fell
onto his foot. Fortunately, the soft sand floor cushioned the impact and
he was not injured.
1. Buford Pruitt, "Warrens Cave Dig," http://onrappel.blogspot.com, 7
April 2013.
Comments: The plug of fill to be dug out was originally estimated to
be 115 feet long, based on a study using a radio transmitter and receiver
system. Over several years and many dig projects, this distance has been
reduced to about 20 feet. Fortunately, this is the only incident that has
occurred there during that time.


********** 20 April
Poor Farm (Greenbrier) Cave, West Virginia
medical issue, aid, no injury
"One of us came back early by helicopter."
Eight cavers from Blue Ridge Grotto went to Poor Farm Cave in
Greenbrier County for a day trip on 20 April. On trips to this cave, the group
usually tours the sportier, northern section first, then back in the entrance
room continue around a southern loop which is shorter and easier. For this
particular trip, though, the group decided to do the southern loop first.
All went well as the group traveled the southern loop. Near the end of
the loop, Patrick Sims (56) went ahead of the group to take photos as the
other cavers climbed down into the entrance room. As Sims was putting
away his camera gear, he suddenly began to feel ill. Sims explains: "It's
hard to describe how | felt, other than I started feeling crappy really quick.
I felt a mild discomfort in the center of my chest, and at first thought it was
simply acid indigestion. It was also uncomfortable to take a breath."
told the group he would wait back at the vehicles while they continued

---------- Page 12 ----------
their trip. As soon as he got up to leave, he realized something was very
wrong and told the other cavers he may need to go to the hospital.
Sims was helped back to the vehicles where he required assistance
taking off his coveralls. At this point, he felt his condition worsening as
his hands began to tingle. His companions called 911 and made arrange-
ments to meet an ambulance en route. They met the ambulance near
U.S. Route 219 and I-64. The ambulance transported Sims to Greenbrier
Valley Medical Center, where doctors determined that he needed to be
flown to a cardiac-care unit in Roanoke. Sims received a stent in his right
coronary artery and, after a few weeks' rest, was ready to resume his
normal activities.

Virginia Caver, August 2013, 31(4).
2. Patrick Sims, e-mail communication, 13 August 2013.
Comments: In his report, Sims says he was incredibly lucky that the
group was so close to the entrance when his trouble began and that he
is grateful for his caving friends who took good care of him.


********** 12 May
Fossil Mountain Ice Cave - Wind Cave System, Wyoming
stranded, aid, no injury
When three Brigham Young University-Idaho students (ages 21,
22, and 24) did not return from a planned trip to the Fossil Mountain Ice
Cave- Wind Cave System, a friend reported them missing. The Teton
County Sheriff's Search and Rescue Team located the trio's vehicle at the
trailhead. Rescue personnel were concerned that the men may have trig-
gered and been caught in an avalanche, so teams were sent to search for
avalanches as well as to look for signs near the cave entrance. A recent
avalanche was discovered but was not searched because evidence was
found that the students had made it to the cave.
Rescuers entered Wind Cave and within 45 minutes located the
three behind a 4-foot-thick plug of ice. It took crews two hours to break
through the ice and free the students, who were unhurt.

3. Emma Breysse, "BYU students de-iced in Wind Cave rescue," www.
jhnewsandguide.com, 16 May 2013.
Comments: Getting stranded in this cave system is unfortunately
a common incident that has been featured in ACA several times. These
young men, like many others, entered the Fossil Mountain Ice Cave side
intending to do a pull-down through trip to exit via Wind Cave. Once the
first rope is pulled, cavers are committed to finishing the trip. Running
into an ice plug is one way to become stranded. Another common reason
is explorers not knowing that a rope should be rigged to climb a 20-foot
pitch to exit the Wind Cave side. Before starting the through trip, a
45-minute round trip into Wind Cave allows rigging the 20-foot pitch and
scouting for ice plugs.
Becoming stranded in this cave system is especially dangerous due
to the cold temperature of the caves and their remote, high-altitude
location. Always research a pull-down trip thoroughly before attempting.
It is also a good idea to go with someone who is familiar with the route
your first time.


********** 13 May
Big Bertha Cave, Kentucky
stranded, aid, no injury
Brian Ahlers (20) and his friend (22) went to Big Bertha Cave in
Bowling Green to video the inside of the cave. Big Bertha Cave is part of
the Lost River Cave System and has a wide, fast-moving stream flowing
from its entrance. After crossing the waist-deep stream, the 22-year-old
felt he was too cold and tired to attempt the trip back across. Ahlers exited
the cave and went for help.
The Bowling Green Fire Department was conducting technical rescue
training exercises nearby and responded quickly. With assistance from the
Warren County Rescue Department, the man was brought out of the cave
one hour after he entered.

were able to respond almost immediately.


********** 23 May
unspecified cave, Virginia
caver fall, injury, no aid
"At the bottom of the pile, there was a 20- to 25-foot very
restricted squeeze/crawl to get out on the other side. This is
where I destroyed what was left of my shoulder."
Seven hours into a cave trip in Virginia, Phil Goldman (47) attempted
to climb over a ledge with 90 feet of vertical exposure below him. Goldman
had already crossed this ledge three times that day, but on his fourth time,
he struggled to make it over. After repeated attempts, he began to make
some progress when he found small holds for his left hand and both feet.
As he reached for another hold with his right hand, both feet slipped out
from under him. Goldman caught a handhold with his right hand but then
fell the length of his arm, dislocating his shoulder.
The pain seemed minimal, and Goldman managed to get over the
ledge. A short distance later, he realized that his injury was worse than
his initial assessment. The team discussed whether to go for help or try
to self-rescue. They opted for the self-rescue and began planning for the
upcoming obstacles: a steep, 100-foot-high mud slope to be climbed; a
section of vertical breakdown to squeeze through, and a 120-foot rope
climb at the entrance. To get up the mud slope, a caver wedged himself
near the top and, using himself as an anchor, provided 80 feet of rope for
Goldman to ascend using two handled ascenders. Goldman believes that
while this was effective, it may have caused more damage to his shoulder.
Squeezing through the breakdown further worsened his condition.
When the cavers reached the 120-foot rope climb, Goldman was
concerned that he would not be able to perform a changeover if needed,
so another caver climbed to the top, pulled up all of the extra rope that
was on the bottom, and rerigged the rope to be able to lower Goldman if
he had trouble while climbing. Another caver helped Goldman put on his
gear and adjust it so that he could climb left-handed. Goldman climbed
the rope and exited the cave without further incident.
1. Phil Goldman, Incident Report, 26 September 2013.
Comments: The team assessed patient condition, rescuer condition,
obstacles, and available gear and decided to initiate a small party assisted
rescue (SPAR) instead of calling for rescuers. Advantages of a SPAR over a
large callout rescue in certain cases can include reduced patient time to
entrance, improved patient morale, reduced amount of gear necessary,
and improved cave conservation. However, caver-rescuers should moni-
tor team fitness and not hesitate to call for additional resources before
members reach the point of exhaustion. Fortunately during this incident,
the challenge was within the abilities of the team, and they were able
to conduct a well-executed SPAR response all the way out of the cave.
2013 Caving Accidents and Incidents

---------- Page 13 ----------
Rigging ropes in such a way that the rappeller/climber can be lowered
to the ground is an excellent preventative measure if there is concern
that someone may become exhausted or stuck on rope. This technique
is known as contingency rigging, releasable rigging, or rigging for rescue,
and is much safer for rescuers than other techniques, such as pickoffs,
when a patient is stuck on rope. The technique is often used by canyoneers
and cavers for rappels in flowing water, as it enables a quick rescue of
anyone stuck in the waterfall.


********** 26 May
Ellisons Cave, Georgia
caver fall, injury and aid
Troy Fuqua, John Burns, Ed Kehs, Jr., and Dwight Kempf (54), all
experienced cavers, entered Ellisons Cave via the Stairstep Entrance/
Incredible Pit (440 feet) at 10:00 a.m. on Sunday, 26 May. Their plan was
to do a crossover trip with another group who entered from the Fantastic
Pit (586 feet) side. The two groups would pass each other in the lower
levels of the cave, and exit by climbing the other pit.
After passing the other group in the cave, they came to a handline.
The handline, 8 to 9 feet long, is knotted and has loops to assist in climb-
ing. Kempf, on his third Ellison's trip, was the last to use the handline. He
lost control and fell, bouncing off a small ledge, sliding down an angular
ledge, and disappearing down a hole, where he then fell about 40 feet.
His friends shouted but received no response. The time was about 3:30
p.m. No apparent route could be seen to descend to Kempf. Fuqua, the
trip leader, left the two other cavers at the site and exited the cave via
the Fantastic Pit side to call for assistance.
While Fuqua went for help, Burns and Kehs searched for a route to
descend to Kempf. After about 20 minutes, they found a route to Kempf.
He was now conscious, but apparently he had been unconscious for about
15 minutes. He had a significant head laceration with a possible basal
skull fracture, his face was swollen, his ribs were tender to the touch,
and his left leg was angulated. Upon further examination, they saw that
the left femur was fractured and had created an open wound. Kempf was
bleeding heavily. Burns and Kehs used improvised materials to staunch
the bleeding and a brake-bar rack to stabilize his femur. They padded the
rack and held it in place using 1-inch tubular webbing. To help prevent
further heat loss, they placed a plastic garbage bag around Kempf. They
made him as comfortable as possible and provided reassurance. This initial
care, provided by Kempf's teammates, likely saved his life.
Fuqua exited the cave at the Dug Entrance and called 911. The first
units arrived at the staging area at the base of the mountain at 6:32 p.m.
The cave entrance is located a mile up the mountain and is accessed by
either a steep foot trail or a slightly longer, rugged road. From the stag-
ing area, travel times were 20 minutes up the road by ATV. Walking the
shorter trail takes about 40 minutes.
Not knowing the condition of the fallen caver or the route to reach
him, the Incident Commander waited for the arrival of cavers who were
familiar with the area. Once entrance control was established, the first
rescuers entered the cave at 9:15 p.m. All rope drops were rerigged with
rescue ropes, and teams moved toward the accident site. Communication
consisted of wired field phones from the entrance to the top of Fantastic
Pit. Walkie-talkies were used to communicate in the pit. A second phone
line was run from the bottom of the pit toward the patient.
When the rescue team reached the patient, and as soon as commu-
nications were established at the site, rescuers requested additional
equipment, including a Kendrick traction splint, a SKED flexible litter,
a spine splint, litter-packaging material, and medical supplies, including
IV fluids and medications. They administered IV fluids, pain medication,
antibiotics, and later a unit of blood. They placed the patient in the litter
atop an Oregon Spine Splint spine board and protected him with a vapor
barrier and large heat packs. A blood pressure cuff and stethoscope were
used to continuously monitor vitals. Once all the needed gear had reached
the patient and paramedics had completed their initial packaging, crews
2013 Caving Accidents and Incidents
began moving the patient toward the entrance at 4:40 a.m.
While awaiting the patient's arrival at Fantastic Pit, rigging crews
prepared for a litter raise, rigging a 1:1 mechanical advantage counterbal-
ance haul system. A rope ran from the litter up to a pulley attached to a
ceiling by strong bolts. Once over the pulley, the rope ran across the pit
to a section known as The Balcony. There, a second rope was attached to
bolts on the wall and dropped into the pit. Two rescuers would provide
the counterbalance weight. To do this, a rescuer attached a brake-bar
rack to the second rope. Attached below by a short tether was a second
rescuer to add extra weight. The main line haul rope was attached to the
upper rescuer. To haul the litter, the upper rescuer began a controlled
rappel with his rack; as the two rescuers descended, the litter ascended.
Because the launch point for the rappeller counterbalance team was
lower than the top of the pit, the rappellers would arrive at the bottom
before the litter reached the top of the pit. It was too time-consuming and
dangerous to tie off the main line, have the counterbalance team ascend
back up some 70 feet and restart their descent. The litter also needed to
be moved horizontally above the pit to the "Attic," where rescuers could
detach the litter and move it toward the entrance. To solve this challenge,
the rescuers rigged a 3:1 mechanical advantage haul system with a rope
grab to be attached when the counterbalance team reached the bottom.
They also rigged (on the far side of the Attic) a brake-bar rack anchored
to a large boulder. They threaded a tagline through the rack. When it was
needed, rescuers slacked off on the tagline as rescuers on the opposite
side hauled the litter across the top of the pit.
The patient was successfully raised up Fantastic Pit, and at 11:45 a.m.
he reached Warm-Up Pit for a second haul of 125 feet, which was already
rigged. The patient exited the cave at 12:30 p.m. and was placed in a four-
wheel-drive vehicle and transported down the mountain to a waiting Life
Force helicopter. The helicopter took off with the patient at 1:30 p.m.
The operation was not finished at this point. There were many
rescuers still in the lower levels of the cave. All of these rescuers had to
ascend the ropes and assist with moving a massive amount of muddy,
wet equipment toward the entrance. All of the cavers were out of the
cave at 6:35 p.m. The total number of personnel involved in the incident
was 106; 71 rescuers entered the cave. Command was terminated at 7:41
p.m., Monday, 27 May.

3. Allan Padgett and John Hickman, e-mail communication, 20 March 2014.
Comments: The fall occurred at the 9-foot handline, which was
knotted and had loops for climbing. The handline was a fixture in the
cave and was not brought by the cavers. Most experienced cavers have
probably used this type of handline and would have used this handline if
encountered in Ellisons Cave. Although the handline was rigged on a very
short drop, the short drop is at the top of another drop with a 40-foot
fall. Knots and loops make it impossible to use ascending and descending
gear on the handline.
The rescuers in this incident were competent, prepared, well-
equipped, well-coordinated, practiced, and efficient. They extracted a
severely injured patient from a remote and difficult location in what can
only be described as an amazingly short period of time; the caver fell at
3:30 p.m. on 26 May and was on the helicopter at 1:30 p.m. on 27 May,
22 hours later. This rescue from Ellisons Cave is a shining example of
how to conduct a successful rescue of a seriously injured patient from an
extreme vertical cave environment. A successful outcome was achieved
not through luck or chance, but as the culmination of years of dedication
in the region to cave-rescue training, planning, practice, and coordination
for just such an event.

********** 28 May
Jewel Cave, South Dakota
caver fall, injury and aid
A Utah family, including a three-year-old girl, took the Scenic Tour,
which is a guided cave tour offered by Jewel Cave National Monument.
Upon arriving at an elevated platform at the top of a set of stairs, the girl's
mother, who had been carrying the little girl, put the girl down. The child
promptly ran over to a railing and fell through, landing on an outcrop of
the cave wall. She then slid down the angled wall below the platform,
colliding with rocks on the way down and falling a total of about 17 feet.
She was taken to the surface by her father and National Park Service
staff, provided initial basic life support stabilization by Park EMTs, and
transported by ambulance to the Custer Regional Hospital. She was then
flown by Life Flight helicopter to Rapid City Regional Hospital, the nearest
Level 2 trauma center.
The girl suffered a basal skull fracture; a broken nose, cheekbones,
and jaw; and numerous abrasions and lacerations. On 1 June, she was
released from the hospital and was expected to make a full recovery. The
family stopped by the Monument visitor center shortly thereafter to visit
staff involved in the rescue.

********** 8 June
Valdina Farm Sinkhole, Texas
lost control on rappel, injury, no aid
On 8 June, a party of 16 people entered Valdina Farm Sinkhole.
Twelve were experienced cavers, and four were novices. The novices
were print journalists and videographers from news organizations in San
Antonio, and the trip's purpose was to assist the media with a story on
the Edwards Aquifer.
The cave's entrance pit descends 75 feet to a large ledge, from
which a second 75-foot drop leads to the floor of the cave. One caver
was assisting the group by carrying gear down the first drop. He weighed
approximately 250 pounds and was carrying an additional 30 pounds of
gear, which was attached to his rappel device with a sling. He was using a
micro-rack and wearing fingerless gloves. When he started to descend, he
did not have the rope over the rack's hyperbar, and when he entered the
free-fall portion of the drop and fully weighted the rack, he was unable
to adequately control the rappel. A bottom belay was ready, but the
caver did not call out for it during the rappel, and he did not engage the
hyperbar. Although the caver was able to maintain a reasonable speed
on descent, he suffered second-degree burns to his fingers, and he lost
significant skin between his thumb and index finger. The caver rappelled
the second drop, and continued with the trip without sharing the extent
of his injuries with the rest of the team. He exited the cave under his own
power, but the injuries took more than six weeks to heal.
1. Geary Schindel, e-mail communication, 10 July 2013.
Comments: It is good practice to begin every rappel with the maxi-
mum amount of friction engaged on the descending device. In the case
of a micro-rack, which has two friction settings, this maximum friction is
achieved with the hyperbar engaged. If engaging the hyperbar causes so
much friction that you cannot move toward or over the lip, then disengage
some of the friction but be ready to re-engage it at the lip or breakover
point. When crossing a lip, going from a slope to vertical, cavers must
anticipate the additional load that will suddenly be transferred to the
descender. This transfer is very sudden and cavers using a lower friction
setting to cross a lip must be ready to reapply more friction to maintain
control. Cavers should practice adding higher friction to their devices
while rappelling so as to be practiced and ready to apply it quickly in an
emergency. Also, in a last-resort, out-of-control situation, fingerless gloves
provide less protection and friction than full-fingered gloves.
Bottom belayers should remain attentive and be ready to apply the
belay, even if there is no vocal call for the belay. Even when the rappeller
is not visible, it is often possible to detect an out-of-control rappel audibly.
Finally, injury or illness should be reported to the rest of the group
so that appropriate decisions can be made about whether or not to
continue with the trip.


********** 22 June
unspecified cave, Arkansas
equipment problem, aid, no injury
"The rescuer followed next, bringing along the fused wad of metal,
nylon, and mud that had once been the caver's ascending system."
A local caver and his companion visited a privately owned cave near
Cozehome to document the cave and its formations through photography.
When they encountered a 30-foot drop down a steep, flowstone slope,
the caver descended to take photos from below. The assistant, who had
no gear or vertical caving experience, remained at the top to set off strobe
flashes. At the bottom of the drop, the floor is mud, 6- to 8-inches deep.
After a photography excursion, the caver attempted to ascend the
rope, but found that the amount of mud caked on his ascenders made it
impossible to climb back up, and each attempt further muddied the rope.
For more than four hours, the caver tried many different ways of getting
back up to the main passage, including scraping the mud off of the rope
and his gear, trying to free-climb out using an old nylon and wood ladder
that was at the bottom of the slope, and even having his assistant throw
down the tail end of the rope to climb out on. When none of this worked,
the caver sent his assistant to call for help.
The Marshall Police Department, Searcy County Sheriff's Office,
nearby National Park Service (NPS) personnel, and local cavers responded
to the callout and assessed the situation. After making contact with the
stranded caver, a rescuer rappelled the slope and supplied him with fresh
clothes, clean vertical gear, water, and food. Once freshly geared, the
caver ascended the majority of the way up the drop. Park rangers hauled
him the final 10 feet when he became too exhausted to continue. The
caver exited the cave under his own power after 17 hours underground.

Comments: Ascending a muddy rope with muddied gear should be a
basic skill of vertical cavers. This incident was exacerbated by the caver's
outdated climbing system with worn teeth on his ascenders.

********** 20 July
Up and Down Cave, Missouri
difficulty on cable ladder, aid, no injury
A group of 10 Boy Scouts, two Scout leaders, and two camp employ-
ees visited Up and Down Cave on the H. Roe Bartle Scout Reservation.
Trips to Up and Down Cave are a planned activity at the Scout camp and
are popular with the Scouts; the cave is frequently visited during the
summer season by groups of 10 to 20 Scouts and leaders.
The cave entrance is vertical, and the group entered using a 30-foot
cable ladder, with one camp staffer staying at the entrance to provide
a belay. The group toured the small two-room cave and then began to
exit the cave using the cable ladder with a belay. Most Scouts climbed
the ladder without difficulty, but one Scout (14) had difficulty climbing,
despite ascending halfway up the ladder several times. He stated, "My
arms are going numb and I can't feel my fingers" each time before abort-
ing his ascent.
The remaining Scouts climbed out on belay until only the one Scout,
a Scout leader, and a camp staffer remained. The camp staffer attempted
to communicate with the outpost director by radio but could not do so.
One camp staffer returned to the main site on foot to summon assistance.
One of the Scout leaders at the cave, Jay Kennedy, is an experienced
caver with cave-rescue training. Kennedy and the remaining camp staffer
inventoried their equipment, including gear in an emergency duffel that
accompanies all groups to the cave. The available equipment included a
150-foot-long static rope, two double pulleys, several carabiners, a sling
loop, and a Petzl Traxion. By this time the other staffer had returned
with a third staffer. The Scout leaders and camp staff decided the most
expeditious method to extract the Scout was to establish a haul system
and belay. One staffer descended into the cave, and the haul system and
belay ropes were attached to a seat harness. Kennedy and the third staffer
were able to extract the Scout without complication.
1. Jay Kennedy, Incident Report, 31 July 2013.
2. Jay Kennedy, e-mail communication, 12 August 2013.
Comments: The Scout group was properly equipped for a trip that
was a routine part of the experience of attending the Scout Reservation.
Bringing equipment for a haul system demonstrates the Boy Scout motto,
"Be Prepared" this case for a Scout unable to ascend the cable ladder.
The group was fortunate to include a caver with cave-rescue training.
Kennedy led a quick and safe extraction instead of waiting for hours for
outside assistance.


********** 31 July
La Crosse Cave, Texas
caver fall, injury and aid
Gill Ediger (65) and others were working on a dig in a cave in south
Austin on 31 July. Shortly after a lunch break, the cavers were gathered
around several leads at the bottom of the pit they had dug open. After
some discussion, Ediger stood to leave and momentarily blacked out, fall-
ing backward into one of the leads, a 10-foot-deep pit. He landed on his
back among several boulders and lost consciousness for about 15 seconds.
When he came to, his friends reported that he was speaking incoherently,
and some left immediately to call 911. Ediger managed to climb out of
the pit on his own and began making his way toward the entrance. The
50 feet he had to travel was mostly walking passage up a slope, which he
managed with only a little assistance. Ediger has no memory of his trip
from out of the pit to the entrance.
A local fire department arrived on scene just as Ediger reached
the entrance. He was transported by ambulance and kept overnight for
observation and treatment for nine broken ribs, some minor vertebral
damage, and lacerations to his face and scalp.

1. Gill Ediger, e-mail communication, 13 August 2013 and 16 October 2013.
Comments: Ediger is extremely lucky that he did not sustain more
serious injuries. Spinal injuries should be considered in all persons who
have sustained a fall, especially a backward fall of 10 feet followed by a
loss of consciousness. Being so close to the entrance was probably strong
motivation to self-rescue. This proximity would also enable a professional
assessment to be performed in the cave rather quickly.


********** 6 August
Weybridge Cave, Vermont
caver fall, injury and aid
"So there I was, blissfully reading the latest issue of ACA that
had just appeared in my mailbox that day and counting my
blessings that my name wasn't in it, when the shrill ringing of
the telephone suddenly blasted me out of my solitude
Vermont's Weybridge Cave is a popular cave for both cavers and
adventure-seeking locals. The entrance passage is sporty with a 20-foot
drop (Nuisance Drop) followed by another drop that is 45-feet deep (Main
Drop). Although both drops can be free-climbed, local grottos discourage
this practice, and most cavers rig the second drop.
On 6 August, two men entered Weybridge Cave and down-climbed
both drops. Neither man was wearing a helmet. When it came time to
exit, one of the men (26) began to climb out of the first pit. Unlike his
companion, this was his first time in the cave. He made it about halfway
up when he slipped and fell 20 feet to the bottom. He initially landed on
his feet but then fell backward, striking the back of his head. When he
was unable to continue due to leg and back pain, his friend left to call 911.
In his report, Steve Hazelton explains what happened next: "The local
Fire Department, a nearby Fire Department Technical Rescue Team, and
the local ambulance responded. The Vermont Cave Rescue Network, a
telephone tree for cavers, was then activated which included retrieval of
the cache of cave-rescue equipment.
"The local fire department established a Command Post near the
entrance. After viewing the narrow entrance passage and the 20-foot
Nuisance Drop about 20 feet inside the entrance, the agency respond-
ers decided that they were not comfortable working in the vertical cave
environment and waited for the cavers to arrive and perform the rescue.
Meanwhile, [the patient's companion] was allowed to enter the cave and
free-climb the drops at least two more times to take extra clothing and
provide emotional support to [the patient].
"The first caver who arrived rigged both vertical drops since no ropes
had been used by the original party. He found the patient to be relatively
stable but with significant lower back pain and an obvious lower leg injury.
Despite having lain on the mud floor for over two hours, the patient was
found to be relatively normothermic [normal body temperature].
"The need for immobilization meant that passage modification would
be needed in several places, in particular the top of Main Drop. The slot
at the top was 12 inches wide and quickly did a zigzag of about 5 feet
down a steep slope. Neither of these was a major obstacle for an average-
sized uninjured caver, but was a major obstacle for a patient packaged
in a SKED® The packaged patient was measured and it was determined
that the slot would need to be widened to at least 16 inches in a way
that also straightened out most of the zigzag. A request was made to the
local agencies to assist with in-cave passage modification and vertical
rigging as there were still very few cavers on scene, but once again the
Incident Commander asserted that they were not properly certified for
such activities in the cave environment and chose to wait for more cavers."
As more cavers arrived, patient packaging, passage modification, and
rigging continued. The Fire Department provided the cavers with an air
chisel and air tanks. The tanks only lasted a few minutes each, requiring
more than 30 tanks to enlarge one section of passage. Another section
was enlarged with the use of a sledgehammer.

---------- Page 16 ----------
The patient was brought up the first pitch using a 4:1 haul system.
A 3:1 haul system was built to move the patient up the second drop and
out through the entrance. The rough and narrow entrance passage made
it
difficult to move the SKED®, so additional rigging was incorporated.
The patient reached the surface 12 hours after first becoming injured. He
was diagnosed with a broken lumbar vertebra and a broken ankle with
peripheral nerve damage.

3. Steve Hazelton, "Cave Rescue at Weybridge Cave, Weybridge, Vermont,"

Comments: Local cavers had practiced a mock rescue of this very
scenario a few years earlier using a log as a patient. During that training,
cavers identified rigging points, passages that would require modification,
and additional hardware that would be needed.
Coordination between cavers and local rescue agencies is crucial
to effective cave rescues. Hazelton concludes his report with these
comments: "A very successful OCR (Orientation to Cave Rescue, a train-
ing conducted by NCRC) was held for the agencies later that fall, with the
mock being a simplified re-creation of the incident. Agency personnel
participated in all aspects of the in-cave activities, including descend-
ing and ascending Main Drop. The actual rescue's Incident Commander
went into the cave as far as the top of Main Drop to see what the cavers
faced for challenges, and plans were developed for in-cave agency roles
should another rescue occur. The local fire department donated money for
additional passage-modification and anchoring equipment for the cache,
and improved techniques for passage modification have been evaluated."


********** 12 August
Torys Cave, Connecticut
stranded, aid, no injury
"This was not the way we planned to spend the day."
Shortly after entering Torys Cave, a woman became stranded at the
bottom of an 8-foot-deep slot near the entrance. Her partner tried for
several hours to help but eventually left to call 911. Gaylordsville firefight-
ers responded, and four firefighters entered the cave. After assessing her
situation, one of the firefighters was able to get behind her and, using
items that were passed to him, built up the floor of the crevice until the
woman could climb out. She was then able to exit the cave under her
own power.

********** 31 August
Raspberry Cave, Arizona
trapped, no injury, no aid
Bob Goforth, Mark Pansing (60), Adam Zipkin, and Mike Van Note
entered Raspberry Cave late in the morning of 31 August with the intent
of digging on some promising leads. They squeezed through the cave's
entrance, a tight crack in basalt that led to a room just big enough to sit
up in. From here they descended through another squeeze into a much
larger room with massive boulders wedged in the ceiling. At the base
of this room was a narrow 10-foot climbdown into a small room with a
lead at the bottom. A 12-foot-long crawl connected this room to another
small room with a second lead. This second lead was determined to be
the more promising of the two.
The foursome began to dig wet mud and rocks out of the lead. The
removed material was passed through the 12-foot crawl and deposited in
the room on the other side. Eventually the diggers decided to call it a day
as they became tired and concerned about the stability of the headwall
overlying the lead.
Goforth exited the cave first as the others collected their tools.
Pansing was next to start working his way out. In the short climb up to the
large room, he was passing tools ahead of him when his shoulder bumped
a large boulder. The chunk of limestone and the mud behind it began to
slide down into the chimney. Pansing attempted to hold it in place while
he wedged other rocks under it. As he started to back down to warn the
others, the boulder slipped and wedged Pansing's head between it and
the wall. Van Note was still in the crawlway when he heard a shout. He
made his way to below Pansing to find that Pansing "was simultaneously
trying to pull free, keep his footing, and not bring what looked like a very
unstable situation down onto himself and everyone else." Pansing was
trying to get free by undoing his chinstrap, but he could not get it to
release. He asked for a knife to cut the strap. As Van Note was passing
him the knife, Pansing suddenly broke free, along with a large amount of
debris that fell into the room below. The boulder had not fallen through;
it simply wedged itself in the chimney, trapping the cavers below.
After 20 minutes, Goforth re-entered the cave to see why the others
had not come out. They told him they were trapped by the boulder and
carefully slipped a crowbar up to him. Goforth enlarged the chimney and
was able to apply leverage to move the boulder out of the way and into a
more stable position. The other three cavers were then able to carefully
ascend the chimney and exit the cave without further incident.

Crawlers Gazette, October 2013, pp. 12-14.
3. Adam Zipkin, personal communication, 16 November 2013.
Comments: "Everyone involved was an experienced caver, which
made the entire episode much less stressful than it might have been with
less experienced individuals. The trapped trio knew that Goforth would
come looking eventually and that the wise thing was to sit and wait rather
than try to dig or ascend a tight spot through shifting rock," said Van Note
in his report. He concludes with this insight: "Still, being trapped, even for
a short period, is an unpleasant experience best avoided."


********** 5 September
Alcove Pit, New Mexico
fatality, difficulty on rope
Two men hunting in the vicinity of Weed encountered 35-foot-deep
Alcove Pit. Locally known as a sinkhole, the lower part of the feature
is vertical and overhung and is described by cavers as a pit. The men
decided to explore the pit using a lightweight nylon or cotton (reports
vary) utility rope tied to a tree or their ATV. The men did not possess
caving equipment and were not wearing helmets. One of the men, Brett
Smith (40), descended the rope partway into the pit but either became
stuck or decided to ascend before he reached the bottom. His companion
attempted to use the ATV to pull Smith up, but the rope broke, and Smith
fell 20 to 30 feet to the bottom of the pit.
Rescuers arrived from the James Canyon Volunteer Fire Department,
the Sunspot Volunteer Fire Department, Lincoln National Forest,
Cloudcroft Emergency Medical Service, the New Mexico State Police, and
the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator. Smith was pronounced
dead at 10:00 p.m., and his body was recovered from the pit by the James
Canyon Rope Rescue Team.

********** 21 September
Scroll Cave, Arizona
exhaustion, no injury, aid
Since 2010, the Western Mappers group has been mapping caves in
southern Arizona one weekend every month. In September 2013, three
three-person survey teams were in Scroll Cave in southern Arizona.
A team of Bob Zimmerman, Sarah Truebe, and Ted Janecki had
moved slowly throughout the day and decided to head out at 3:30 p.m.,
a little earlier than planned. An early exit would allow them more time to
negotiate the entrance climb. The entrance is a 60-foot-deep vertical slot
that can be free-climbed but is exposed, so many cavers prefer to rig it.
One of the other teams passed them on the way out, and shortly
after it became clear that Janecki was struggling. Before reaching the
entrance, he ran out of water and what little food he had brought with
him. He also did not bring kneepads, which made the hands-and-knees
crawls much more difficult.
When they got to the entrance climb around 6:00 p.m., Janecki was
tired but willing to climb. Zimmerman offered to climb first so that there
would be someone at the top if Janecki needed help; Truebe would then
climb last. Janecki forgot his Croll ascender, so he attempted to climb
with a makeshift frog system. Ten feet up the climb, he was exhausted
and began slurring his words. Truebe suggested that he down climb back
to the floor. At this time, the last team arrived and provided Janecki with
the last of their water and food.
At the surface, Truebe piggybacked a 2:1 haul system onto the main
line using the only other rope the group had, 50 feet of 9mm. By this time,
the last three cavers had exited the pit using the free-climbable route,
so the haul team had enough people. Janecki climbed about 20 feet but
again began to tire, so the readied team hauled him the rest of the way
out. Everyone was out of the cave by 8:50 p.m.
1. Sarah Truebe, Bob Zimmerman, Incident Report, undated.
Comments: Janecki continued to have problems with his vision and
muscle cramping even after he finally ate and drank, but his symptoms
eventually subsided. Several days are often required to recover from
severe dehydration. Dehydration can often take one by surprise, and
severe dehydration can be a life-threatening emergency. Just as running
low on lights might end a cave trip prematurely, so should running low
on water.
Kneepads should be considered essential safety gear for nearly every
caving trip, especially a cave like Scroll that features hundreds of feet of
mandatory crawling, climbing, and stemming.


********** 23 November
Binkley Cave System, Indiana
fatality, medical issue
Two cave divers and seven support cavers entered the Binkley Cave
System via the Blowing Hole Entrance with the intent of exploring a
water-filled passage deep in the cave. After traveling approximately two
miles through stream passages, tight squeezes, and over large breakdown
piles, support caver Tim McLain (49) suddenly collapsed. After checking
his airway, breathing, and circulation, his companions began CPR. After
15 minutes, Adam Haydock and Nick Benton left to start a call out for
2013 Caving Accidents and Incidents
rescue. Leaving most of their gear behind and traveling light, they were
able to exit the cave in about one hour. Besides calling the local authori-
ties, Haydock also phoned several rescue-trained cavers. The cavers still
in the cave continued CPR for an hour but were unable to revive McLain.
More than 50 volunteer cavers responded from Indiana, Kentucky,
and Georgia to bring McLain's body out of the cave. Through their coordi-
nated efforts and a strong commitment to their fallen friend, the recovery
operation was completed less than 12 hours from the time of the incident.

Comments: Friends report that Blowing Hole Cave was one of
McLain's favorite caves. He participated in the trip that connected Binkley
Cave to Blowing Hole, making the Binkley Cave System the 11th longest
cave in the U.S. After his death, the Binkley cavers decided to name
something yet to be discovered after McLain. In June 2014, a discovery
was made of a large river passage. During the next trip to survey it the
following month, a large room was also discovered. It was decided that the
room and passage were worthy of his name; the room has been named
McLain Mountain, and the passage is named McLain River.

Neffs Cave, Utah
caver fall, injury, no aid
Brent Schvaneveldt (51) and others were making their way up from
the bottom (-1,163 feet) of Neffs Cave when Schvaneveldt fell 8 to 10
feet while climbing up a narrow ledge. He landed hard on his right foot.
Despite some pain and discomfort, Schvaneveldt made it out of the cave
and down the mountain under his own power. A photo taken the following
day showed extensive swelling and bruising of his foot, ankle, and toes.
1. Brent Schvaneveldt, Incident Report, 5 December 2013.
Comments: Incidents involving sprains, strains, and minor contu-
sions are not often reported to ACA. However, these injuries are probably
the most common. If more reports of these types of injuries filled these
pages, would it change what you carry in your first aid kit? Please report
all incidents and carry appropriate first aid supplies.


********** 15 December
Pettyjohns Cave, Georgia
caver fall, injury, no aid
A 20-year-old male was crossing a narrow ledge when he slipped and
began to fall. The man grabbed a fixed rope that served as a traverse line,
but when the rope received his full weight, it broke. He fell about 20 feet,
landing near another large drop. A member of his group lowered him a
harness, and the group was able to extract him using another rope. He
was able to make it out of the cave under his own power despite a cracked
sternum and several abrasions.
1. James Long, Incident Report, 18 December 2013.
Comments: Relying on ropes you find already rigged in a cave should
always be considered with a great deal of caution. The report did not
mention why a harness was not used where a fall hazard was present, even
though one was available. Perhaps the group did not trust the traverse
line enough to clip into it?

********** 11 February
Sistema Sac Actun (Cenote Calimba), Quintana Roo,
Mexico
fatality, out of air
Bernard Reeves (48) of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, died 11 February
near the Cenote Calimba exit of the Sac Actun Cave System near Tulum.
The cause of death was drowning due to running out of air before reach-
ing the surface.
The Sac Actun Cave System is highly complex, with guidelines leading
to a number of passages. There are three exits in close proximity: Cenote
Calimba, Cenote Box Chen, and Cenote Ho Tul. Another line, the Paso de
Lagarto line, can be followed all the way to the more distant Grand Cenote
exit. Some of the guidelines begin as "T" intersections, with the two
directions connected, and some are "jumps." In a jump, the line leading
through the side passage is not connected, and the divers are supposed
to make a connection using a jump reel to maintain a temporary continu-
ous guideline to the surface. In a complex system such as this, markings
can be very confusing. Line arrows are supposed to point to an exit, but
multiple exit points create confusion as to which exit an arrow may be
pointing. Cave divers use personal markers at potential points of confusion
to ensure that they follow the correct path when exiting.
Reeves was an experienced and trained cave diver. He was part of
a group of seven, but he elected to do his dive as a solo diver while the
rest of his group operated as two teams of three. They entered through
Cenote Calimba. Before the dive, he was observed listening to another
team talking about diving in the direction of Cenote Box Chen, and he told
the rest of his group that he was going to follow that plan as well. He had
never been in that section of the cave before. He entered the cave shortly
ahead of the rest of the group.
During their dive, one of the groups observed the equipment that
Reeves used to mark his path, and after the recovery it was noted that he
had picked up that equipment during his attempted exit. His computer
was also analyzed. Consequently, even though he was diving alone, it is
possible to determine his complete path accurately. At the "T" intersec-
tion for the Paso de Lagarto line, he placed a personal marker (wooden
clothes pin) on the Cenote Calimba side of the intersection to mark his
exit direction, and continued on the Paso de Lagarto line. At the jump
intersection leading to Cenote Box Chen, he used a jump reel to connect
to that line, but he did not put a personal marker on the Cenote Calimba
side to mark his exit direction. At that point, there is a permanent line
arrow pointing toward the distant Grand Cenote exit.
Reeves continued toward Cenote Box Chen until his turning point
at 40 minutes, at which point he headed back the way he had come. He
pulled out his jump reel and reached the Paso de Largarto line, but he
mistakenly followed the line in the wrong direction, heading toward Grand
Cenote. He continued in that direction for 800 feet, realized his mistake,
and turned around. His unexpected detour used too much of his air to
allow him to reach his exit, and he was found in 19 feet of water only 200
feet from the Cenote Calimba exit, his air completely consumed.

2. "Perece buzo canadiense por ahogamiento," http://www.poresto.net,
undated.
Comments: An analysis by Phillips, who led the recovery, suggested
the following as factors contributing to the accident: an overly complex
dive plan, unfamiliarity with this section of cave, and unclear or insufficient
directional referencing at the Paso de Lagarto/Box Chen jump.


********** 8 August
Devils Eye Spring, Florida
fatality, used wrong gas
Carlos Fonseca brought a standard 80 cubic-foot tank to Florida
from Canada, marked as oxygen, and labeled MOD 20. This means the
Maximum Operating Depth of the tank was 20 feet, as oxygen is toxic
below that depth.
He was preparing the tank to take into the cave and use it as an extra
"stage" bottle to extend his penetration distance when one of his dive
buddies pointed out the markings of MOD and oxygen. Fonseca told him
not to worry about it because he knew it was air and that he had filled it
himself in Canada. No one saw Fonseca analyze the tank that morning.
He used this tank to travel about 400 feet into the cave, to a depth of
about 90 feet. At that point, he began having seizures.
The buddy team attempted a rescue, and several people heard the
surface team shouting for help. They responded and assisted getting
Fonseca ashore. Unfortunately, the high oxygen level caused too much
damage and he later died at the hospital.
1. Jim Wyatt, www.decostop.com, undated.
2. Forrest Wilson, e-mail communication, 5 December 2013.
Comments: After the incident, the tank was analyzed by two
cave divers and at least two members of the Gilchrist County Sheriff's
Department. The analyzers read 98% oxygen. His back gas doubles were
analyzed as 30% oxygen (which was safe at that depth).


********** 9 October
Volusia Blue Spring, Florida
one fatality (drowning), one injury
Samuel Slack (36) and Daniel Vansickle were diving in Volusia Blue
Spring when Slack made a "throat slash" motion, indicating that he was
having difficulty breathing. Vansickle removed his own regulator and
passed it to Slack so that the two men could take turns using it, a tech-
nique called buddy breathing. Vansickle reported that when Slack would
not return the regulator, he had to yank it away, then swim to the surface
for help. Once 911 was called, Vansickle returned to Slack, but found him
floating motionless in 100 feet of water. By inflating Slack's vest, Vansickle
was able to bring him to the surface. Paramedics on scene were unable
to revive him. Vansickle was treated for decompression sickness in a
hyperbaric chamber and later released.

********** 18 November
Jackson Blue Spring, Florida
used wrong gas, injury and aid
A diver (38) was injured but successfully rescued by his buddy in
the Jackson Blue Spring cave in Merritt's Mill Pond in Marianna on 18
November. The diver and his buddy were using rebreathers while diving
to a depth of approximately 96 feet in the cave. A rebreather recirculates
the air the diver breathes, scrubbing out carbon dioxide and adding new
oxygen as needed. Another cylinder carrying what is called "diluent"
allows the rebreather mechanism to dilute the amount of oxygen in the
air as needed, and the diver can manually flush the system with it when
appropriate. A bailout bottle is another cylinder taken to use in case of
emergency, giving the diver a chance to use an open-circuit system in
2013 Caving Accidents and Incidents

---------- Page 19 ----------
case the rebreather does not function properly.
The two divers' plan was to do a short dive for photography purposes
and then return to the surface for a more serious second dive. Because
they were planning only a short dive, they did not take their normal
diluent tanks with them. They left those on the surface and used their
bailout bottles for both diluent and bailout. They went into the cave with
dive propulsion vehicles (DPVs, or scooters). They navigated the shallow
cavern area and then descended the chimney, a narrow opening leading
down to the floor of the cave at about 96 feet. They were approximately
400 feet from the mouth of the cave when one of the divers signaled he
was having trouble. He shut off his rebreather regulator, spit it out, and
reached for his bailout regulator. By then his buddy had gotten to him with
his bailout regulator. The buddy later reported that the patient did not
take the regulator effectively, but the buddy held it in his mouth anyway.
The buddy then exited the cave with the patient, using his DPV for a
rapid ascent. Upon surfacing, the buddy called 911, and help soon arrived.
The patient was unconscious at that time. The patient was evacuated,
recovered in the hospital, and was released after several days.
While the patient was being evacuated, a scuba class being taught
by Edd Sorenson exited the cave. Sorenson is the individual who normally
deals with diving accidents and rescues in the area. Sorenson recovered
and examined the equipment used. The analysis of the patient's dilu-
ent/bailout showed that it contained 52% oxygen. The tank had been
accurately marked at 52% prior to the dive, and personnel from the Cave
Adventurers dive shop indicated that they had filled the tank, with an
oxygen mix between 50-55%, as requested by the diver. The bailout gas
his buddy used during the rescue was analyzed at 38% oxygen.
1. "Diver Critical Following Blue Springs Mishap," www.wjhg.com, 19
November 2013.
2. John Adsit, e-mail communication, 6 December 2013.
Comments: Although the practice is not universal, most rebreather
divers use both bailout and diluent gas mixes designed to have safe oxygen
levels for the deepest point of their dives. If too much oxygen is used
while the diver is under increased pressure, it is possible to have central
nervous system oxygen toxicity, which can lead to a seizure. Opinions
on the normal safe level for oxygen partial pressure usually vary from
1.2 to 1.4. At 96 feet, that level of partial pressure would come from a
breathing mix with between 31-36% oxygen. A mix of 52% will have a
partial pressure of about 2.0 at that depth, which is much too high to be
considered safe.

Jailhouse Cenote, Quintana Roo, Mexico
fatality, medical issue
Brent Cooper (44) of Missouri died while diving in the Jailhouse
Cenote near Tulum on the Mexican Yucatan Peninsula. Cooper was diving
with three friends, and they were just beginning the second dive of the
day, with Cooper in the third position on the team. One hundred feet into
the cave at a depth of 35 feet, Cooper stopped swimming and sank to the
bottom of the cave. His team members evacuated him immediately and
began CPR. After 50 minutes, paramedics arrived and determined that
he could not be revived.

********** 25 December
Eagles Nest, Florida
two fatalities, out of air
A father and son testing out new diving equipment received as
Christmas gifts died in the Eagles Nest Cave System when they appar-
ently ran out of air deep in the cave. The father, Darrin Spivey (35), was
certified as an open-water diver with no known advanced training or cave
certification. His 15-year-old son, Dillon Sanchez, had no diving certifica-
tion. Postings on social media indicate that they had been diving before
in Eagles Nest and other cave systems that do not have the means of
checking certification before entry. Pictures posted on social media show
them wearing appropriate cave-diving gear in a standard configuration.
The Eagles Nest Cave System is considered one of the most advanced
and challenging cave-diving sites in North America. The entrance is a
small opening at the bottom of a spring. That opening leads to a narrow
passage descending into a very large room called the Ballroom. The top
of a debris cone there is 130-feet deep. From the Ballroom, passages lead
to both the upstream and downstream segments of the cave system.
When the two did not return home after the dive, an informal
recovery team gathered at the site. Not knowing where in the system
they would need to look or how complex the recovery effort would be, a
recovery diver looked briefly into the Ballroom and saw Sanchez immedi-
ately. The team then recovered both bodies from the Ballroom. Sanchez
was found positively buoyant on the ceiling near the top entrance to the
Ballroom; his father was found on the debris cone below. The father's
long hose regulator had been deployed, suggesting that Sanchez had run
out of air during the dive and the two had shared air until the father ran
out as well. There were two full tanks on the debris cone, indicating that
the tanks had been left there awaiting their return, but they expired just
before reaching them.

3. Holly Gregory and Ferd Zogbaum, "Authorities: Divers were trying
out new equipment before fatal accident," www.baynews9.com, 26
December 2013.
Comments: The cave system is more than 300 feet deep in places.
The cave is recommended for highly experienced and trained cave divers
only, especially those with training in the use of trimix (breathing gases
used in deep diving containing high percentages of helium) and in the
decompression procedures and equipment needed to ascend safely from
those depths. Spivey and Sanchez attempted the dive using only air for
their breathing gas, and they did not have the normal equipment or
breathing gases for decompression.
Analysis of a computer used on the dive showed a maximum depth
of 233 feet, indicating that they must have left the Ballroom and run out
of air during their return. Diving at that depth for as long as they did
demands a significant need for decompression stops during the ascent,
and it is doubtful that they would have been able to complete those stops
with only the two extra tanks, even if they had reached them in time.

caver fall, injury and aid
Two dozen cavers turned out for a cleanup and conservation project
at the Northeast Cave Conservancy's Clarksville Cave Preserve. During
the cleanup of downed trees and debris from tropical storm Irene, cavers
noticed two women hiking in the direction of one of the cave's entrances.
Twenty minutes later, emergency vehicles arrived and an officer asked
the cavers the location of a woman reported to be trapped in a cave.
The cavers escorted law enforcement officers to the cave's multiple
entrances and found one of the women at the Wards Entrance. She
reported that her friend had fallen into the cave and was unable to get
out. Onesquethaw Volunteer Fire Company crew members pulled the
woman out, placed her on a stretcher, and transported her to a waiting
ambulance. She dislocated her shoulder in the fall.

Comments: The women had no caving gear and did not intend to
enter the cave. The article concludes, "The passage of thousands of cavers
has made the limestone at the Wards Entrance as slick as polished steel."
Ironically, caves that attract thousands of visitors often become more and
more challenging as limestone gets polished over the years, and hand- and
foot-holds become rounded and smooth.

Sinking River, Colorado
dog found in cave
Cavers Mel Eady-Pumplin, Rich Pumplin, Mary Klaus, Jon Schow, and
Becky Coffman went to Sinking River with plans to bounce Colorado's
deepest pit (169 feet). Since it is a blind pit that usually has water in the
bottom, their plan was to send in one person at a time to rappel, change
over, and climb back up. Pumplin descended first and the others could
hear him talking in the pit below. Eady-Pumplin remarked it was the same
tone he used when talking to their dog and assumed he had found a chip-
munk or other small animal. Pumplin returned to the surface and told the
others "Put on your small-party rescue hats. There's a dog down there!"
Klaus describes what happened next: "I quickly volunteered to be
the one to go down and 'play' with the dog. I took a large backpack, some
supplies to tie a harness, and scrounged together some cave snacks that
were dog-appropriate and rappelled down. Luckily the water was low so
there was a beach where the dog could get out of the water and I only got
a little wet crossing to get to her. She was a small black-and-white cattle
dog (maybe 30 pounds) and she was very happy to see me. Amazingly,
she had no injuries that I could find. Since she was well tempered, unin-
jured, and small enough, I decided to try to get her into the backpack,
but I found I couldn't do that without help. Rich came back down to help
and we got her in the backpack. We had talked about hauling her up but
that would have been a bumpy, terrifying ride for her. She was small, so
I decided just to climb up with her on my back. She was so calm for the
ride I started to wonder if she was still alive; I think she was enjoying the
relative warmth of the backpack! After we got to the top and off rope we
let her out of the backpack. She was so incredibly happy to see the sun
again, and she showed us by rolling around in the dirt in delight. We tried
to get her to follow us back to camp, but she seemed to know where her
home was and headed off in the opposite direction. We hiked back the
next day to check on her, but there was no sign of her or the cows that
had been in the area the day before, so we think she found her home!"

********** 11 September
Unspecified littoral caves, Manitoba, Canada
illness while searching for caves, aid, no injury
During a trip to relocate some wave-cut caves along the southern
shore of Dawson Bay on Lake Winnipegosis, a 71-year-old caver on the
trip suffered an episode that resulted in acute memory loss.
The incident occurred while a group of four cavers was paddling in
two canoes along the shore of the large lake, some six miles southeast
of their campsite. Shortly after the first cave came into view, located on a
sheer 80-foot-high cliff, the wind came up and forced them to take shelter
around a bend. As the two canoes pulled together to determine how to
deal with the growing wind, the 71-year-old caver in the front of one of
the canoes began asking the other bowman where they were and what
they were doing. Recognizing that something was wrong, the bowman
signaled to the others that they had to make landfall immediately.
Once on land, the gravity of the situation became apparent as the
confused caver not only couldn't remember much of anything from the
last few years, but also kept forgetting any new information he was given
within a matter of seconds.
Although the group had a Spot Messenger, they decided to use
their cell phones to try to call for assistance. While the oldest friend of
the injured caver stayed with him, the other two made their way to the
top of the cliff they had canoed past earlier. From there, with the help
of a long branch and a speaker phone, they were able to contact 911.
Despite giving exact GPS coordinates of the location, the two spent
many minutes and precious battery life trying to explain to the operator
exactly where they were. They were informed that rescuers were going
to come by boat and that they should wait on the cliff to signal them.
After relaying the information to the others, they settled in and watched
as dark clouds blew across the lake and occasionally sprinkled them with
a light rain.
Meanwhile back on the water's edge, the disoriented caver "enter-
tained" his friend by asking him the same questions, "Where are we?
What are we doing?" every minute for hours on end.
Three hours later, three policemen from nearby Sapotaweyak Cree
Nation arrived in a small boat. They mentioned their delay was attributed
to the 15-foot-high waves they encountered on their way over from the
other side of the lake-likely caused by the storms that were observed
from the cliff. The caver and his friend were loaded into the boat, while
the other two cavers each manned a canoe in tow. A slow pace was set
toward a boat launch about five miles to the south.
Ten minutes into the journey, the boats were intercepted by a larger
Manitoba Conservation boat carrying two Natural Resource officers, an
EMT, and a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer. The ill caver,
who was now finally beginning to regain his memory, and his friend were
then transferred to the larger boat, which quickly sped off to a waiting
ambulance. Meanwhile the two canoes were detached from the smaller
boat as it returned home. This left the remaining two cavers paddling solo
to the boat launch until the Manitoba Conservation boat returned to pick
them up along with their canoes.
The ill caver was taken to a hospital a couple of hours away and
underwent a battery of tests, but by the time the other cavers arrived, he
had regained his memory, save that day's earlier events, and was already
released. The patient made a full recovery.

********** 16 September
unnamed sinkhole, Missouri
fatality, fell into sinkhole
Curtis Powelson (31), a Marine stationed at Fort Leonard Wood, fell
to his death into a recently opened sinkhole. Around dusk, Powelson told
his wife that he just shot a deer and was returning to the woods to try to
track the animal. When he failed to return home, his wife reported him
missing to the Pulaski County Sheriff's Department. Law enforcement
officers and firefighters then began a late-night grid search, which ended
shortly after 3:00 a.m. when Powelson's body was discovered at the
bottom of a sinkhole near his home. The sinkhole is described as about
the size of a car at ground level and is estimated to be 65- to 70-feet deep.
Authorities believe that tall vegetation along with low light conditions
made the sinkhole very difficult to see.
Pulaski County Assistant Coroner Michael McCart and a firefighter
were able to rappel the pit to retrieve Powelson's body. According to
McCart, the sinkhole appeared fresh and was likely a result of recent
rains: "From the looks of the sinkhole itself and the lack of debris that's in
the sinkhole, it's fairly new," McCart said. "We had several firefighters and
deputies that almost stepped into it themselves, just out there wandering
around looking for him last night."
1. Waynesville Daily Guide Staff, "Sinkhole envelops local hunter/marine,"
www.waynesvilledailyguide.com, 17 September 2014.
Comments: Most cavers know of a pit entrance that is difficult to
see from even a short distance, and maybe even thought, "I could almost
fall into this pit if I wasn't careful." This incident involves a young Marine,
who presumably was fit and had good reflexes, good eyesight, and good
situational awareness. Walking in karst terrain, especially through vegeta-
tion or under low-light conditions, calls for vigilance.

unspecified caves, Washington
missing while ridgewalking, presumed dead
Kristopher Zitzewitz (31) and a friend set out to search for caves in
the Big Lava Bed area of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest on a Saturday
morning. They became separated around 2:00 p.m. When Zitzewitz's
friend could not locate Zitzewitz, he called 911. Despite being hampered
by record amounts of snow and rain over the next few days, more than
100 people searched from vehicles, motorcycles, helicopters, and on
foot with canines.
The search resumed the following summer, but to date, Zitzewitz
has not been found.

Marbo Cave, Guam
fatality, drowning
Marbo Cave is a freshwater coastal cave with clear, cold water. It
is well publicized on the Internet and a popular attraction for locals and
tourists. On 4 January, Larry Lujan (38) was pulled unconscious from the
water. CPR performed on the way to the hospital did not revive him. No
information was given to the cause of drowning.

********** 28 January
Jewel Cave, South Dakota
other, injury, no aid
Blase LaSala (26) and three other cavers were on a survey trip in Jewel
Cave on 28 January. A short time into the trip, LaSala pinched his finger
between a hand-line and the rock wall. He informed the trip leader but
determined that he would be able to continue with the trip.
After four hours of caving, which included going up and down a
number of hand-lines and ladders, LaSala took off his glove and noticed
swelling and discoloration. He and a nurse in the group re-examined the
finger and, due to its flexibility and lack of pain, did not think it was more
than sprained. About 11 hours after the incident, the group exited the
cave without further issue.
Concerned that the injury could impede his abilities on an upcoming
cave trip, he consulted a doctor over the phone the next day and came
to the conclusion that it was not broken. A week later when the swelling
went down, he noticed that the tip was crooked and got an x-ray. The
finger was broken but had already healed incorrectly. It was too late to
fix without having to break it again.
1. Blase LaSala, Incident Report, 29 October 2014.
Comments: LaSala reports that his grip and flexibility have not been
affected and that his crooked finger will help to remind him to be more
careful next time.


********** 31 January
unnamed karst feature, Tennessee
trapped, injury and aid
After a day of surveying in one cave, Marion Smith (72) and Jim Fox
(44) discovered another karst feature nearby. Fox worked to enlarge the
discovery just enough to enable Smith to enter. Smith determined that the
feature had no leads to explore and, while attempting to exit, found that
he was having difficulty getting back out of the tight hole. He requested
that Fox rig a rope and pass down a foot ascender to help him get out.
During this time, Smith noticed a loose sandstone rock and
commented that it was big enough and heavy enough to possibly trap
him if it came loose. The boulder did come loose and trapped Smith by his
thighs and hips. Working together, Fox and Smith realized that they could
not push the rock down past Smith's legs or bring it up past his ribcage. Fox
then tried digging a parallel hole to tunnel over and remove the rock, but
they abandoned this plan when Smith felt other rocks beginning to shift.
Local agencies and cavers were called and came to assist. Another
parallel hole was dug, and this time cavers, with rock-removal tools, were
able to work their way underneath Smith. He was in a lot of pain by this
time and was given an IV by medical personnel. Smith was wrapped in
blankets, and the cavers performed some microblasting work on the wall
2014 Caving Accidents and Incidents
around the boulder. Clinton Elmore thought it would be possible to place
a small shot in the rock that was pinning Smith, since his experience with
that particular type of rock showed that it does not fracture and produce
flying projectiles. While drilling the hole in the rock, the percussion from
the rotary hammer drill moved the rock enough that Elmore could hold
it up just enough for Smith to climb out past it. After being trapped for
six hours, he was flown to a local hospital where he checked himself out
a few hours later. He has since made a full recovery.

********** 13 February
McBrides Cave, Alabama
stranded, aid, no injury
Four cavers entered McBrides Cave to do a pull-down through-trip.
At one of the drops, they encountered more water than expected and
decided it was not safe to proceed. Having already pulled the ropes behind
them, they had no choice but to wait for assistance. When they missed
their callout time, their surface watch notified authorities. Members of
the Chattanooga Hamilton County Rescue Service responded, hard-rigged
the cave, and located the missing cavers. Although cold and wet, everyone
was able to exit under their own power.
1. Brad Tipton, personal communication, 12 July 2014.
Comments: As always, a surface watch can make a big difference in
rescue response time.


********** 27 February
Natural Well, Alabama
stranded, aid, no injury
Two men sport-rappelling in Natural Well became stranded when
they were unable to ascend back out. A third person who did not enter
the pit called for help. Rescue crews had the two men out within an hour
of arriving on scene. No information was available as to why they were
unable to ascend.

********** 7 March
Cave of the Bells, Arizona
caver fall, injury and aid
A group of Venture Scouts went out for a weekend of camping and
caving in southern Arizona. The Scouts had been to another Arizona cave
a few times before, and one leader had visited Cave of the Bells once
before, but none were experienced cavers.
They picked up the key from the Forest Service and were reminded
that everyone in the cave should wear a helmet. At the cave, Venture Scout
leader Mitch Hamilton (39) was the only one with a helmet; the other
three adults and three boys had forgotten theirs. Hamilton remembers
thinking, "Well, I guess I'll be the dork with the helmet."
The group explored the cave, and on their way out, one of the boys
had trouble getting up through a tight section. Another boy tried a differ-

---------- Page 24 ----------
ent way around to go help him. Hamilton followed the second boy. While
negotiating this new section, Hamilton lost his footing on a traverse and
slipped about 15 to 20 feet into a nearby pit. He lost consciousness for
about 10 minutes. One of the leaders exited the cave and drove a short
distance to get cell phone service and called 911 at 10:35 p.m.
The Sonoita-Elgin Fire Department responded and was at the cave
entrance at 11:46 p.m. The patient was found to be awake and mobile by
the time the first rescuer rappelled to his location, but he was suffering
from a concussion and broken ribs. He was placed on a spine board and
brought out of the cave before 1:00 a.m.
1. Kelly Ricard, e-mail communication, 17 March 2014.
2. Kevin Venos, Joseph DeWolf, and Jen Huss, phone communication, 30
October 2014.
3. Mitch Hamilton, phone communication, November 2014.
Comments: Fortunately, Hamilton was "the dork with the helmet,"
since he was the one that ultimately needed it the most. Without it, his
brain injury could have been much worse. While it is impossible to reach
every group that is interested in caves, cavers should make an effort to
engage with local Scout and youth groups to ensure that their curiosity
about caving can be satisfied in a safe and ethical way. In some caves, not
wearing a helmet is a violation of permit conditions. Such violations and/or
rescues ultimately jeopardize everyone's access to these managed caves


********** 16 March
unnamed cave, Pennsylvania
caver fall, injury, no aid
Seven cavers entered a cave that they had recently been surveying
and digging in a little after 10:00 a.m. After traveling almost 2,000 feet
toward their destination, Chris Hill (66) became frustrated with the slow
pace and many rest stops. He went ahead of the group, carrying a case
of drill bits in his right hand. Crawling over a series of fissures in the floor,
his neoprene glove slipped on a sloping, sand-covered ledge, and he fell
forward into a narrow fissure. Hill's right shoulder, right knee, and mouth
all struck rock as he fell 10 feet. The walls closed in tight enough to stop
him from falling the remaining 5 feet to the bottom. Despite the tight
quarters, Hill was able to get his feet under him and climb back out. He
checked his injuries and found nothing that seemed out of alignment.
He also checked to make sure he had all of his teeth and was happy to
discover he did.
Hill decided to continue with the trip but found the contortions
needed for surveying painful. At 3:25 p.m. he and two other cavers decided
to head for the entrance. One of the other cavers was already very tired
and moving slowly, so rest stops became more frequent and longer in
duration. As Hill waited each time for the slower caver, his shoulder would
stiffen and have to be stretched and loosened before continuing. Hill and
his team exited the cave at 7:30 p.m.
1. Chris Hill, Incident Report, undated.
Comments: In his report, Hill acknowledges two actions as contrib-
uting to his accident: allowing frustration (over the pace of the team) to
lead to a lack of caution, and not taking extra care while carrying heavy
equipment where maintaining points of contact is especially critical.


********** 4 April
0-9 Well, Texas
caver fall, injury, no aid
Laura Battle (30) had been caving for a little over a year when she
visited 0-9 Well for a second time as part of an eight-person team. She
entered the cave second, traveling with the third caver. The first caver
had gone ahead to rig a drop, and five more cavers would be following.
On this particular day, the water was much lower than on Battle's first
trip, and in the Waterfall Room she could not locate the passage they
intended to take. She found a muddy funnel with markings as if some-
one else had gone down it. She decided to see if this was the route and
proceeded to climb down.
Battle soon realized that the funnel was slipperier than she thought.
She slid 5 to 10 feet down and through an unseen hole at the bottom.
From there, she fell another 10 feet down to a stream passage, the one
she had been looking for. She located the opening she should have come
through and called directions to her companion.
After assessing her condition, she found that she had lost a chunk of
skin from under her chin and her tailbone was very sore. She continued
with the trip, and another caver gave her a piece of duct tape for her chin.
After the trip, one of the cavers drove her to a clinic where she received
five stitches in her chin.
1. Laura Battle, Incident Report, 7 April 2014.
Comments: Battle discusses several ways her accident may have been
prevented in her report, including waiting for others who knew the route
to catch up, and not chimneying down a muddy slope without knowing
where it went. She concludes that the most valuable lesson learned is
to remember the seriousness of this accident not by the severity of her
injuries, but rather by the severity of the possible injuries.


********** 12 April
unspecified cave, Virginia
caver fall, injury, no aid
A group of Virginia cavers was one hour into a recreational cave trip
when a 54-year-old male slipped and dislocated a shoulder. Members in
the group used a SAM Splint, elbow pads, and tape to fashion a splint for
the patient after an attempt to reduce the dislocation was unsuccessful.
Once the cavers exited the cave, they had to make a decision as to
how to get back to their vehicles; they could either climb rope back up a
50-foot cliff with another steep slope above that, or they could hike out
across private property. Although the hike out would be gruelingly steep
and technically trespassing, it would not require ropes or vertical gear.
Several cavers in the group had recently completed NCRC's Orientation
to Cave Rescue training and decided it would be safer to have the patient
walk out rather than haul him up a cliff. The patient determined he was
strong enough for the hike and agreed with the choice. He was belayed
with webbing up the steepest slopes but otherwise was unassisted. Four
and a half hours later, his shoulder had been reset at a hospital and his
discomfort greatly minimized.
1. Doug Duncan, personal communication, 16 July 2014.
2. Mark Boland, e-mail communication, 23 October 2014.
Comments: These cavers properly applied their cave-rescue train-
ing, as "horizontal" solutions are generally preferred over more complex
vertical ones.


********** 4 May
Paradox Cave, Tennessee
rock fall, injury, no aid
Matt Robinson (34) was on rappel in a waterfall in Paradox Cave when
a section of the lip at the edge broke free. Several large rocks fell, striking
Robinson. He suffered a compound fracture and severed tendons to one
of his hands. With the help of his caving partner, he applied a tourniquet
to stop the bleeding and exited the cave without further assistance.
Robinson notes that it was a long trip to the hospital but that he had the
necessary medical supplies to keep himself stable.
1. Matt Robinson, Incident Report, 6 May 2014.
2014 Caving Accidents and Incidents

---------- Page 25 ----------
Comments: Tourniquets can be risky if not applied correctly and
removed soon enough. However, tourniquets have recently been used
with success by the military in Afghanistan and Iraq and are now regaining
some favor within the emergency medical community. Severe bleed-
ing must be stopped, and sometimes a tourniquet may be necessary.
Cavers should obtain proper training before attempting any risky medical
intervention.


********** 24 May
Cemetery Pit, Georgia
equipment problem, no injury, no aid
A group of cavers with varying amounts of vertical experience visited
Cemetery Pit for a recreational trip. A female in the group, who had
ordered a new seat harness for the trip, asked for someone to check her
gear before entering the cave. While in the cave, another caver thought
her harness "looked extremely loose," and he suggested that she tighten
it. Later in the trip, she asked for another gear check before ascending
back up a 160-foot pit. The gear check revealed that none of the three
straps on her harness was doubled back.
1. Christopher Lafferty, Incident Report, 14 July 2014.
Comments: This incident highlights the responsibility of cavers to
be familiar with their own gear and know how to properly safety-check
it. Relying on a "buddy check" was only 50% effective on this trip and
is no real substitute for knowing your gear and doing a personal safety
check before committing at each rope. Along with this caving example of
a faulty buddy check, there are other recent tragedies and near misses
from other vertical disciplines. In 2009, a wildland firefighter fell to his
death from a helicopter because his rappel device was connected to his
harness by a rubber O-ring and nothing else. His gear had been checked
by three other people prior to the failed rappel.


********** 2 June
Speedwell Cave, Virginia
stuck, aid, no injury
A 19-year-old woman was part of a North Carolina group reportedly
doing a training exercise in Speedwell Cave. While negotiating a crawlway
with a crevice in the floor, the woman slipped and became wedged from
mid-thigh to mid-abdomen in a section of the crevice approximately 8
inches wide. When her group was unable to extricate her, they called for
help around 3:30 in the afternoon. Rescuers first attempted to put her
in a harness, rig a pulley as a directional, and haul her vertically out of
the crevice. When she experienced pelvic pain during this operation, the
rescuers decided that the crevice would first have to be enlarged. A chisel
and sledge hammer were used to remove some of the rock around the
patient's body until she could be hauled out more easily. Due to medical
concerns, she was then placed in a litter for transport. A short haul was
needed for one steep section of passage. Despite being stuck for six hours,
she showed no signs of obvious injury but was flown to a hospital as a
precaution. The reports did not state what type of training exercise the
group was performing, but it did mention that all members of the group
had helmets and headlamps.

********** 7 June
County Line Cave, New Mexico
flooding, no injury, no aid
John Lyles led four cavers on a survey trip to County Line Cave in the
gypsum plains of Chaves County. Major thunderstorms were predicted
for this and two bordering counties on the day of their trip. Since the
forecast covered such a large area, and it was before the traditional
monsoon season, the cavers thought the chance of a storm hitting their
location was small, so they continued with their trip. Before entering the
cave, they checked the forecast again. Storms were still predicted, but
the weather appeared calm in their area.
Shortly after entering the cave around 10:00 a.m., Lyles pointed
out two skylights, and the cavers discussed their use by the local bats.
Continuing through the cave, they negotiated several low crawls. Jen
Foote raised some concerns about the cave possibly flooding, but she was
reassured that it was a big cave and it would take a significant storm to
produce flooding. The group continued on and found a debris line from
a previous flood over their heads. A little farther on, Foote decided it was
time to leave. She exited the cave alone while the others stayed to survey.
They surveyed for four hours before turning for the exit.
When the cavers reached the skylight area, they found the floor of
the cave littered with golf ball-sized hailstones. Not only that, but the
entrance was taking water, threatening to make it impassable. Fortunately
for the cavers, Foote, after waiting out the storm in a vehicle, had rigged
a handline for the cavers through one of the skylights. Although it was a
difficult climb, with no handholds and a width too great to chimney up
or straddle, the cavers managed to climb out.
On the surface, the cavers found their two vehicles battered by the
hail, with cracked windshields and broken side mirrors. Water flowed
over the surface of the gypsum plain, obscuring the two-track road. In
his report, Lyles stated, "The cave exit turned out to be the least of our
problems," and provided a lively description of their drive out of the area.
Fourteen tornadoes were recorded during this storm, including one that
touched down only 18 miles from the cave.
1. John Lyles, "GypKaP Report: County Line Cave, Chaves County, NM, June
7, 2014," Southwestern Cavers, 53(1), January-February, 2015.
Comments: Recent droughts had created conditions that exacerbated
flooding during the storm. While we now have the benefit of hindsight,
it is difficult to ignore the fact that the cavers entered a flood-prone cave
on a day when intense storms were predicted for the area. Fortunately,
they exited before any major cave flooding occurred. Also fortunate is
that Foote exited early and had a handline waiting as an option to avoid
the flooding entrance crawls.


********** 20 June
Waikapala`e Cave, Hawaii
fatality, drowning
A Pittsburgh man (27) drowned for unknown reasons while swim-
ming with others at Waikapala`e Cave. The cave and others nearby are
publicized on the Internet. An enticing description of this cave reads,
"This particular cave has an unusual effect for those who want to brave
the ice-cold water. It is called the Blue Room. At the back of the main
cave is a small opening into another, smaller room accessible only by
swimming. Once inside the smaller chamber, look toward the main open-
ing. The sunlight reflecting off the freshwater makes everything around
you turn blue. Viewing in the Blue Room is best during high tide as the
sunlight has a narrower opening into the chamber and more of the blue
color is reflected."

Comments: Any kind of sea cave exploration such as that mentioned
in the cave description must be carefully calculated for surf, tidal fluctua-
tions, and undercurrents, and persons must be equipped with appropriate
safety gear. Never underestimate the power of the sea.


********** 28 June
Laurel Caverns, Pennsylvania
caver fall, injury and aid
A participant on a wild cave tour in Laurel Caverns fell about 2 feet
and broke his right leg. The Fairchance Fire Department responded along
with members of the Mountaineer Area Rescue Group (MARG). The
Allegheny Mountain Rescue Group (AMRG) was put on standby should
more resources be needed. The patient was out of the cave four hours
after his accident.
1. Douglas Moore, e-mail communication, 30 June 2014.
Comments: Both MARG and AMRG are wilderness search-and-
rescue teams with several rescue-trained cavers in their groups. They
have established dispatch systems and are integrated with other public
safety agencies. This has allowed both groups to provide initial response
teams to cave-rescue incidents. All of the 911 centers in northwestern
West Virginia and in western Pennsylvania have been advised to contact
MARG and AMRG, respectively, for assistance if they have a cave-rescue
incident. These two groups then contact the local grottos to get caver
resources involved. This level of pre-planning and coordination becomes
invaluable when an incident happens.


********** 28 June
Wind Cave, Pennsylvania
stuck, injury and aid
A 33-year-old woman was reportedly exploring Wind Cave with a
companion when she fell into a crevice 30 feet from the entrance. Details
of her injuries were not reported, but rescue crews said she was having
difficulty breathing. Using slings and ropes, rescuers brought the woman
to the surface and carried her one mile through the woods in a litter to
an ambulance.
1. P.J. Reilly, "A woman was rescued from a cave in Martic Township
Saturday night," http://lancasteronline.com, 28 June 2014.
Comments: Wind Cave, aka Cold Cave, is one of several caves locally
called the Cool Caves. In 2010, there were two separate rescues in Wind
Cave. The caves were reported as abandoned mines and the incidents
therefore classified as caving-related incidents in the 2009-2010 issue of
American Caving Accidents. They are in fact tectonic caves.


********** 28 June
Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico
illness, aid, no injury
A team of Andy Armstrong, Bonny Armstrong, Jose "Chino" Gomez
(46), and Karel Hilversum entered Lechuguilla Cave on a rigging trip
intended to last about 12 hours. The cavers carried 610 feet of new rope
between them, cut into specific lengths for replacing old ropes on five
pitches in the Northwest Passage, a side branch of the Western Borehole.
Once there, the cavers spent about 2.5 hours derigging and rerigging the
passage and then began the return trip to the surface, carrying out the
old ropes.
The team had a snack at EF Junction and then split into teams of two
traveling about 10 minutes apart. Andy and Gomez were in the second
group. Soon after this, Gomez succumbed to an apparent attack of dehy-
dration and exhaustion. He first reported feeling not quite right near the
C-71 Traverse, about 1.5 hours from the entrance but still below Boulder
Falls and other pitches. After a short break at C-71, all seemed well again
until the bottom of Glacier Bay. Here Gomez stopped and vomited into a
Ziploc bag several times. After some water, he said he was feeling some-
what better, and he and Andy traveled on. At the bottom of the handline
at the base of Colorado Room, Gomez explained that he needed to stop
for a rest. Andy could hear the others up at Pack's Peak and went to go
inform them of the situation. Gomez then began vomiting again. When
he was finished, he had lost a significant amount of fluid.
Once everyone traveled down to Gomez's location in the trail at the
bottom of Colorado Room, Hilversum, who is bilingual (Gomez is a native
Spanish speaker) and a Wilderness First Responder (WFR) instructor, took
over as medic. Hilversum immediately began treating Gomez for shock,
elevating his legs and providing a Mylar® bivouac bag for warmth. It soon
became necessary for the others to provide extra heat to Gomez by lying
down next to him, as he was cold and shivering.
Hilversum began a wilderness-rehydrating protocol where Gomez
took one mouthful of water every 10 minutes. Gomez would doze off
in between sips but always drank every 10 minutes. After two hours
of this, the team wanted to see if Gomez could move up to the base of
Boulder Falls in order to assess his ability to self-rescue. However, as soon
as Gomez sat up, he vomited all of the water back up. (Throughout the
entire ordeal, all fluids were contained in bags and cave kegs. None was
spilled in the cave.)
At this point, the team realized that Gomez would not get out of the
cave on his own power-at least not soon. After some deliberation, the
team decided to send for help, as Gomez would need to be rehydrated
intravenously. Gomez was too "shocky" to be hauled vertically in his
harness, so the team decided that he would need to either be hauled out
in a litter in a horizontal configuration or be rehabilitated in the cave. Since
the litter rescue option sounded terrible to everyone, including Gomez,
the team decided to go for and bring back medical help and rehydrate
Chino intravenously in the warm, dry cave.
The team moved Gomez to the west of Pack's Peak at the base of
Boulder Falls, where he was able to sleep comfortably in the warmer,
less breezy alcove there. At this point, the team had been in the cave for
about 15 hours.
Andy and Bonny left the cave and reached the surface at 3:00 a.m.,
Andy to call for help, and Bonny to retrieve the three liters of water that
were stashed at the entrance. Bonny re-entered the cave with the water.
Andy hiked to the trailhead and then drove until reaching cell service and
called for help at 4:22 a.m.
After responders drove from Carlsbad, and gear was assembled and
packed, the team left Carlsbad Caverns National Park headquarters at
7:30 a.m., reaching the cave entrance around 9:00 a.m. Andy re-entered
the cave with local caver/paramedic Nate Skelton and Carlsbad Caverns
National Park cave resource office staff Stan Allison and Shawn Thomas.
Skelton carried IV equipment and other drugs. The others carried verti-
cal rescue gear, food, stoves, Gatorade, water, and bivy gear. Thomas
quickly made contact with the team at the bottom of Boulder Falls and
was relieved to hear that Gomez was stable and that all three cavers had
slept comfortably in the 68-degree cave for the last five hours.
Skelton treated Gomez for dehydration by administering nearly
three IV bags over the next two hours. Gomez showed almost immediate
improvement once the IV was started. The other cavers worked to rig a
counterbalance haul on 150-foot Boulder Falls for when Gomez was ready
to go. Every so often, Allison would ascend to the surface to communicate
with the NPS Incident Commander (IC) by park radio. Each time, Allison
would assure the IC that the situation was under control and that they
did not need additional resources.
At about 1:30 p.m., Gomez awoke from a two-hour nap and
announced that he was ready to climb to the surface. He had made almost
2014 Caving Accidents and Incidents

a complete recovery due to the fluids he received. The counterbalance
was attached in case he needed assistance, but Gomez climbed under his
own power. By 4:45 p.m., all team members reached the bottom of the
entrance pit. As it was 105 degrees in the desert above, the team waited
out the hottest part of the day in the entrance pit, but all reached the
surface by 6:00 p.m. Gomez had been in the cave for 33 hours.

3. Andy Armstrong, Carlsbad Caverns National Park Trip Report, 16
August 2014.
Comments: This incident served as a good learning experience for all
involved and confirmed the idea that training and commitment to rescue
readiness leads to more positive results in real rescues. These factors did
not just fall into place; they are the result of a years-long commitment by
Carlsbad Caverns National Park, their volunteer cavers, and cave rescuers
in the Carlsbad City Fire Department to work toward safer caving and a
more effective rescue environment.
On this incident involving seven people in the cave, made up of the
original team plus the local responders, three were NCRC Instructors, and
four were NCRC Level 3. In addition, there was one paramedic and two
Wilderness First Responders. The Incident Commander was attentive,
should the team have required additional resources, but did not flood the
limited space of the cave environment with unneeded gear or personnel.
Considering that the temperature was 105 degrees on the 1.5-mile-long
hike to the cave, this was a wise move for rescuer safety. Limiting the
number of rescuers underground contributed to a calm working envi-
ronment free of chaos. This benefitted both rescuer and patient morale
throughout the incident.
Because the members of the caving team are trained in small party
assisted rescue (SPAR) and have actually conducted a SPAR from the same
cave, it was very tempting to want to just haul Gomez the rest of the way
out of the cave once he became incapacitated. This impulse was reinforced
by the desire to get out of the cave after a long trip. Fortunately, the team
was able to see the error in this approach considering Gomez's condition.
Instead, they let the medical situation drive their decision making, leading
to a good outcome for Gomez. Focusing on what is right for the patient
tends to lead to patient improvement. Focusing on being in a cave rescue
tends to prolong the cave rescue.
Last but not least, it cannot be stressed enough to keep an eye on
your teammates. The team feels that spending two days in 109-degree
desert heat before the trip may have contributed to the incident, causing
Gomez, who lives in the tropics, to become dehydrated before the trip
even began. Don't hesitate to ask about team members' food and water
consumption, even when things appear to be going well. Everyone on the
trip saw Gomez drinking water, but no one asked him how much water
he had been drinking, because he was caving so quickly and efficiently.

Boy Scout Cave, Idaho
other, injury, no aid
Marc Ohms led an Orientation to Cave Rescue training for employ-
ees of Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve and local
cavers. On the final day of the training, participants were conducting a
mock rescue at Boy Scout Cave. A 28-year-old law enforcement ranger
was repositioning himself from a kneeling to standing position to help
maneuver a patient in a litter when he felt three pops in his knee. This
occurred at the cave's entrance. He moved out of the way and others
brought the mock patient out of the cave. Several of the newly trained
rescuers applied ice to the new "for real" patient's knee and transported
him to a vehicle in a wheeled gurney.

1. Bonny Armstrong, Incident Report, 25 July 2014.
Comments: The ranger said he had knee problems during his tour in
Afghanistan in 2009, but this was the first time it had given him trouble
since returning to the States. Moving a loaded litter in a cave environment
is hard, demanding work, and rescuers often overstretch or otherwise
overdo it. Care must be taken to first ensure rescuer safety, before that of
the patient. Fortunately, this was only a practice, so the "for real" injury
did not increase the complexity of the rescue by then having two patients
to carry to the trailhead.


********** 28 July
Bryant Mountain Cave, Tennessee
caver fall, injury and aid
Two 18-year-old males and two 20-year-old females set out to explore
Bryant Mountain Cave without helmets and with only two lights between
them. Near the end of the cave, Conrad VanOrder climbed down 4 feet to
a ledge overlooking a 30-foot-deep pit. When he tried to climb back up
to the others, he slipped and fell to the bottom of the pit.
One of his companions left the cave to call for help. The local Fire
Department and EMS responded and extricated the patient within two
hours. He had broken both bones in his lower right leg.

********** 2 August
Fulford Cave, Colorado
rock fall, injury, no aid
Marty Reames(39 took a few new cavers into Fulford Cave, an easy
horizontal cave in Colorado. After she climbed down a short webbing
etrier, the next caver accidentally kicked some rocks down as he was
crawling to the etrier. The largest rock, approximately softball-sized, fell
10 feet, ricocheted off the wall and hit Reames in the mouth. Fortunately,
the worst of her injuries was a sore lip for a couple of days.
1. Marty Reames, e-mail communication, 4 August 2014.
Comments: Reames said, "From this experience I learned even when
you're on an easy horizontal cave trip you should still teach all new cavers
to yell 'ROCK' if they dislodge anything that could fall on someone else.
Now I'll probably overwarn people for a while." Never stand in a fall zone,
even if the drop is only 10 feet.


********** 8 August
Lucifers Lair, Utah
equipment problem, injury, no aid
Three cavers entered Lucifers Lair on 8 August to continue pushing
leads in the bottom of the cave. The primary goal of their explorations
was to connect with Main Drain Cave, a cave directly below with 1,300
feet of explored depth. At a 20-foot drop, two cavers descended without
incident. The third caver (50) rerigged the drop to better pad a potential
rub point. He tied a figure-eight knot, wrapped the rope around a rock
projection, but forgot to clip the figure-eight to the rope with a carabiner.
He attached his rappel device to the rope and leaned back over the edge.
The caver and the rope fell to the bottom of the pit.
The other cavers, who had gone ahead, heard a thud followed by
groaning sounds. When they reached the injured caver, they found him

---------- Page 28 ----------
unconscious and having difficulty breathing. He was lying on his back with
one leg twisted unnaturally under him. When he regained consciousness,
he showed signs of a concussion and significant damage to one shoulder
and a leg. Subsequent medical examinations showed the main injuries
to be a shattered shoulder blade and minor compression fractures in
the back.
Stranded at the bottom of the pit, the cavers discussed what to do
next. They ruled out attempting to free-climb the pit due to the hazardous
nature of the climb. Two other cavers were on the surface in camp, but
they might not come looking for the cavers for several hours. The two
cavers (one of them the patient's son) eventually lassoed a rock projection
near the edge of the pit. By ascending the rope and then free-climbing a
short section, the first person up rerigged the rope.
The injured caver was able to ascend the rope and one other rope
with some assistance from the others. A difficult section of cave passage
called Slither Squeeze proved to be more difficult. Unable to pull, push,
or properly orient himself to get through the restriction, the injured caver
relied heavily on assistance from the others. Out of the cave, he slowly
limped down the mountain to their campsite.
1. Chris Erickson, Incident Report, 28 February 2015.
Comments: The patient describes himself as experienced and gener-
ally cautious and still expresses disbelief at his mistake. One method to
prevent rappelling accidents is to stay clipped into an anchor while testing
your rappel device. If something is wrong, it should be apparent before
you commit to your rappel device. In this incident, the caver may have
noticed the faulty rigging if he had clipped into it as a safety.


********** 20 August
Ophir Cave, Montana
stranded, injury and aid
Two 18-year-old males and one 18-year-old female entered Ophir
Cave at 6:00 p.m. None of the three had a helmet, and they had only
one light source apiece. They were dressed with few insulating layers.
Their vertical system to negotiate the two in-cave drops of 30 and 60 feet
consisted of 1.5-pound folding kayak watercraft anchors as grappling hooks
and cotton-core utility rope with a working load of 200 pounds that they
had purchased at Walmart. Before leaving for the cave, one of the teens
"jokingly" told a coworker that if he didn't show up the next morning for
work, it was because he was stuck in a cave.
When they reached the first drop, they placed a boat anchor in a
wedge of rock and tied overhand knots for the entire length of the rope.
The males proceeded down the overhung drop hand-over-hand while the
female waited at the top. The next drop immediately followed, and they
used the same method to descend the next 60 feet. At some point, one
of the teens accidentally kicked some rocks on his friend, causing minor
injuries to the friend's shoulder and arm. When it was time to ascend,
neither teen was able to climb the rope. They made voice contact with
the female, who without the guidance of the other two, spent the rest
of the night trying to find her way out of the cave.
The next morning, when one of the males failed to show up for work,
his coworker remembered the offhand remark and drove to the teen's
house to look for him. Not finding him there, the coworker then drove to
the cave and found his truck parked nearby. The coworker went a short
way into the cave and found the female, who was still trying to find her
way out of the cave using her phone as a light (her exit should have taken
only 15 minutes). The coworker called 911.
Duncan Adams and Kathy Weigand of Lewis and Clark Search and
Rescue made up the initial response team and entered the cave to assess
the situation. From the top of the first drop, they were able to make voice
contact with the two teens and found that they were not seriously hurt
but were just cold and hungry. Other rescuers arrived and rigged a rope
at the cave's entrance that made it to the bottom of the first drop. A
second rope was tied to this and one rescuer rappelled to the stranded
teens with extra harnesses. Here the rescuers discovered that the teens
had cut their rope and burned it in 6-inch-long segments so that they
would "have something to burn to keep us warm."
The cave was rerigged with haul systems, and the teens were brought
up the drops and escorted out of the cave. They had spent 24 hours in the
cave; the rescue was completed in four hours. After an on-scene medical
evaluation, the teens were released to their parents.

Comments: The teens said they had successfully used this "vertical
system" once before in the cave. Hopefully now they understand the
limits and dangers of their system and will seek out appropriate vertical
caving training.

Pettyjohns Cave, Georgia
stranded, aid, no injury
Three men entered the popular Pettyjohns Cave for a day of recre-

climb on the way out, one of the other men left the cave to call for help.
Rescue crews responded to the 2:00 a.m. call, already exhausted from
fighting a fire for most of the day. Once the man was helped up the climb,
however, he was able to exit under his own power.

********** 11 September
Sausage Cave, Tennessee
caver fall, injury and aid
When a 59-year-old caver slipped and fell 10 feet in Sausage Cave,
six agencies responded. A staging area for rescuers was established, but
a mile of travel was still required on a hiking trail to a steep ravine.
The cave's entrance is located in a bluff with a short, steeply
downsloping horizontal crawl ending at a 15-foot vertical drop. The
reporting party met the rescuers at this drop and led them to the patient,
who was located two drops further into the cave. The patient was located
at the bottom of a 12-foot pit and appeared to have pelvic injuries. As
a medical team assessed the patient, plans were made for extrication.
A narrow, 30-foot vertical slot presented the biggest challenge, so a
team was assembled to begin microblasting the tighter portions. This work
began at 11:30 p.m. and was completed around 1:30 a.m. the following
morning. This was especially dangerous work for the team, as the blasting
was done in very tight quarters.
Patient transport began around 2:00 a.m. The patient was hauled up
the 12-foot pit with a counterbalance raise. The next section of cave was
a horizontal, but narrow, canyon. It took one hour to move the patient
less than 50 feet through it. A 3:1 haul system then raised the patient up
the 30-foot slot. This too was slow going due to the considerable space
constrictions. Even after two hours of blasting, some sections were only
20 inches wide.

After being raised up the 15-foot pit, the patient was out of the cave

********** 30 September
unspecified cave, Texas
equipment problem, injury, no aid
On September, Jim "Crash" Kennedy (53) and Bill Larsen (57) went
to a cave in Bexar County on a scientific work trip to collect invertebrates.
Both cavers were well-prepared for the trip, and they had more than 40
years of caving experience each. Larsen had been to the cave before, and
Kennedy had not. The gated cave entrance is at the base of a sinkhole
and has a short 25-foot drop just inside the gate. Cavers typically rig the
pit outside the cave, then run the rope through the gate and down the
pit. Kennedy and Larsen rigged the pit in this way and then clipped the
rope through an existing deviation that would allow the rope to hang in
the middle of the pit.
The deviation was rigged with a carabiner and a piece of webbing;
the webbing was anchored in a ceiling crack-possibly to a chockstone.
Neither Kennedy nor Larsen got a good look at the anchor in the ceiling,
but Kennedy tested it several times, then weighted it and found that it
held. Kennedy proceeded down the drop and had gone less than 10 feet
when the deviation anchor failed. This caused him to swing hard into the
wall, then slide and scrape down it for a few feet as the slack from the
deviation came out of the rope. Kennedy was using a mini-rack rappel
device and did not lose control of the rappel. He stopped and did a quick
self-assessment, found that nothing was broken or dislocated, then
continued to rappel to the bottom of the pit.
The impact was so hard that it shredded Kennedy's right elbow pad
and tore his t-shirt across his back. He had severe contusions and abra-
sions on his right elbow and left triceps as well as scrapes to his back.
Larsen, who was still at the top of the pit, asked Kennedy if he was OK and
if he wanted to leave the cave. Kennedy thought that he could continue,
but he then encountered bad air after traveling only about 15 feet. Since
they would have to leave the cave anyway, Kennedy ascended the pit,
and he and Larsen derigged the rope and left the cave. Kennedy cleaned
his scrapes at home and did not seek medical treatment. Larsen did not
remember the deviation from his previous trip to the cave, but said it was
possible that it could have been there. The cave is gated, and access is
restricted, but the cave does see some traffic, generally by experienced
people. Kennedy and Larsen felt they had no reason to suspect bad rigging.
1. Jim Kennedy, Facebook post, 2 October 2014.
2. Jim Kennedy, phone communication, 5 February 2015.
Comments: This accident could have been worse if Kennedy had not
maintained control of his rappel. A less experienced vertical caver may
have let go with the brake hand after such an impact. Kennedy's elbow
pads also prevented his injuries from being worse. When using existing
rigging, inspect the anchor and be sure that you trust it. Kennedy did test
the deviation before rappelling on it, but the anchor still failed partway
into his rappel. If he and Larsen had been able to inspect the anchor in
the crack, they may have decided not to trust it. It is not known what the
anchor was and what exactly failed. Deviation anchors can see significant
forces and should be inspected before use.

Butler Cave-Sinking Creek System, Virginia
caver fall, no injury, no aid
During a survey trip to push leads in the Complaint Section of the
Butler Cave-Sinking Creek System, Tony Canike (51) left his group to check
a lead. He found a 10-foot climbdown with a big passage below. Since
the climb looked easy, he proceeded down, maintaining three points of
contact. At one point, both of his feet occupied the same foothold, 6 feet
above the floor. The foothold broke and Canike fell, landing on his back.
Unhurt, he was able to climb out and suggest that his team rig a handline
before exploring that section further.
1. Tony Canike, Incident Report, 11 January 2015.
Comments: Maintaining three points of contact for safety comes
naturally to experienced cavers. But as Canike points out, "The three
points of contact rule doesn't help much if both feet are on the same
hold, one hand is on a not-very-positive hold, the other hand is finding a
new hold, and the foothold breaks."


********** 12 October
Run to the Mill Cave, Tennessee
lost, no injury, no aid
On the last day of the 2014 TAG Fall Cave-In, nine cavers with varying
amounts of vertical experience visited Run to the Mill Cave on a permit
from Southeastern Cave Conservancy, Inc. One caver elected to remain
on the surface while the other eight entered the cave at 4:00 p.m. The
cave starts with four short drops followed by a 100-foot-long passage
filled with waist-deep water and a 30-foot drop-all before arriving at the
cave's biggest drop of 167 feet, which is known as Tilted Well. Some of
the cavers planned to turn around after the last drop, while others would
continue to explore the river passage beyond the bottom of Tilted Well.
After the waist-deep water, one caver became very chilled and
decided to turn back. She left the group, leaving seven people in the cave.
After all seven had rappelled Tilted Well, one male and one female caver
decided to start climbing out. A second female decided to climb out also,
but this may not have been communicated to the other two cavers. The
four cavers at the bottom waited until they heard the last climber call
off rope at the top. They then traveled farther into the cave. After their
explorations, they began climbing out, pulling up the ropes behind them
and carrying them out of the cave. When they reached the surface, they
realized that the second woman who had ascended Tilted Well was not
accounted for.
At this point, the cavers were not sure if the missing caver was lost
in the dark on the surface or still in the cave. The group split into teams
to search the surface and check the cave. One person was stationed at
the entrance. The two cavers entering the cave focused their search on
side passages between the entrance and the top of Tilted Well. A little
past 2:00 a.m., the two-caver search party in the cave made voice contact
with the missing caver. She was off the main route and the two cavers
could not find a way to get to her. While one caver continued to try and
reach her, the other went to the entrance to inform the others that she
had been found. Upon his return with an extra caver, they found the
missing caver being escorted out. She was tired and cold but moving
under her own power.
The other cavers helped her get on rope at each of the drops, and
although she had trouble with some of the lips, she made it out unas-
sisted a little after 4:00 a.m.

erty manager.
Comments: When the missing caver reached the top of Tilted Well,

---------- Page 30 ----------
the two cavers in front of her had already gone ahead. She found her
way to the next rope and ascended to the top but got lost between there
and the water section. It is not clear if the male leading this small group
knew he was leading two other people out. The female in the middle was
inexperienced and probably did not know to communicate this or stay in
voice contact with the female behind her. When large caving teams start to
break up and go separate ways or head for the surface at separate times,
it is good for everyone to be clear on the plans and make sure every caver
is accounted for in the new plans.

********** 28 June
unspecified karst spring, New Mexico
other (difficulty exiting), no injury, no aid
To explore a karst spring in Sandoval County, cave diver Bill Mason
was accompanied by an open-water diver and three cavers for support.
Mason dove to minus 60 feet in less than 30 minutes. After his dive, he
had a great deal of difficulty exiting the spring.
The opening to the spring at ground level measures about 1 by 4 feet.
Four feet below the surface is a ledge that a person can stand on. The
ledge creates another constriction before the passage bells out, dropping
7 feet to the water below. When Mason attempted to climb back up the
funnel, he found that without gravity on his side, he could not get up the
lower constriction with his tanks on. Due to CO bubbling up from the
water, it was not safe to remove his equipment and breathe the air in the
pit. After several attempts, he decided to drop his PFD and hand his tank
up to Dave Decker while still breathing from the tank. Decker had to hold
his breath as he reached down to grab the tank.
One hour later, Mason completed another dive but had a plan for
an easier exit. This time he dropped his tanks and used a pony bottle air
tank at the surface with a 7-foot-long regulator hose for the climb out.

Two cave divers survived an incident in which a navigation error
almost caused them to run out of breathing gas before making an exit.
The two were using dive propulsion vehicles (DPVs, or scooters) to propel
themselves into the cave. They were carrying their main two tanks in side-
mount configuration, and they were also carrying two additional tanks in
what are called stage bottles to extend their gas supply.
Their planned return trip was to be on the main line, which is also
called the gold line. Florida caves usually have a gold-colored line running
through the main portion of the cave to guide divers in and out. Side

tunnels that have been explored have white lines that usually do not
connect to the main line so that divers exiting in reduced visibility will
not be confused as to which line to follow. When divers intentionally go
to a side tunnel, they connect this "jump" with a temporary line that
they bring with them.
Approximately 2,300 feet from the cave entrance, in a section of
the cave called the Trash Room, the gold line takes a sharp left turn, and
there is a jump straight ahead called the Rabbit Hole bypass. It is a rarely
used jump that is not on most maps. It is a tight and silty passageway
that requires advanced cave-diving skills. Traveling with scooters, the two
divers lost track of the gold line during their exit and continued into the
Rabbit Hole bypass without realizing they had made a jump.
The first part of the passage is much like the main passage and is
easily navigated with scooters, but when the divers reached a restriction,
their scooters and four tanks each were too much for the space. The
environment is very silty there, and the two divers caused a silt cloud
that reduced visibility to zero. The lead diver found himself in a position
in zero visibility where he could not navigate back with all his gear. The
second diver was able to exit the side passage, where he returned to the
main line and exited the cave in hopes of getting help. After a while, the
visibility cleared slightly, and the lead diver was able to get back to the
gold line and begin his exit.
Not certain that he had enough breathing gas left to make the exit,
he went to where he knew another diver had stashed a safety bottle. He
found it and continued his exit. As he was about to enter the cavern zone,
he was met by diver Edd Sorenson, who had been called to assist. The
lead diver and Sorenson were later joined by his original buddy, who also
returned to help. The three exited the water without further incident.

********** 14 February
New Hall Cave, Jamaica
attempted murder, injury and aid
A 17-year-old boy who had been missing for two days was found
severely injured in a cave near Maggoty. The boy reported that two other
teenagers had first tried to drown him in the cave. When that failed, they
stabbed him, set him on fire using kerosene and a tire, and left him to
die. Two youths were soon taken into custody. Later reports suggest that
the boy and the accused may have been involved in a "lottery scamming"
scheme that turned violent.

Pertle Spring Research Cave, Missouri
infant found dead
Two biology students from the University of Central Missouri were
conducting research on wintering snakes in a cave in the Pertle Springs
Recreational Area when they discovered a broken lock to the cave. Inside
they found a pile of burned trash and reported the vandalism to police. The
police took a statement from the students but did not investigate further.
Two days later the students returned to their research site and noticed
an "awful smell." On further inspection of the trash, they discovered the
remains of an infant's body.
Nineteen-year-old Latasha Wilson and 20-year-old Zakary Carter
were charged in the case.

Comments: It is unfortunate that the police did not investigate the
cave break-in and vandalism themselves. One of the research students
reportedly was traumatized by the gruesome discovery.
17-24 May
multiple caves, Colorado
various injuries
During the NCRC National Seminar in Divide, Colorado 9,000 feet
elevation), students and one instructor received minor injuries during the
course of the eight-day cave-rescue training. Reported problems include
headaches due to altitude, a minor ankle sprain, an arm sprain, exacerba-
tion of a chronic back problem, and a puncture wound to the hand from a
branch while traveling to the caves. There were also reports of a lingering
respiratory infection and a case of iritis (inflammation of the iris of an eye)
after the seminar, although it is not clear if these conditions are related
to the seminar. According to Dr. Stephen Mosberg, Medical Coordinator
for the NCRC, this seminar had fewer injuries and illnesses than usually
occurs at these seminars.

********** 3 June
Swimming Hole Pit, New Mexico
attacked by Africanized bees
Ken Harrington (70) and Dave Belski (77) were examining a series
of sinkholes in Eddy County. The sinkholes are formed by water coming
up from below and dissolving gypsum, leaving pits or collapses. When
they arrived at Swimming Hole Pit, Harrington worked his way down to
the water while Belski explored the other side of the pit. Belski called for
Harrington to join him to see some deep crevices where the edge of the
pit was calving off.
As Belski slid down into one of the cracks, he stirred up an unseen
nest of Africanized bees. They first began to chase and sting Harrington,
and then they went after Belski. Both men ran for the safety of their
truck and proceeded to kill the bees that had followed them in. In his


********** trip report, Harrington quotes Belski: "I got stung four times. One on the
lip, two on the arm, and one on the top of my head. I swallowed one and
had several try to take up residence in my ear." Luckily neither man had
an allergic reaction.

Comments: Harrington and Belski have mapped more than 500
cave and karst features in Eddy County, and have run into bees only
one other time. In both incidents, the bees pursued them all the way to
their vehicle and continued to swarm even when they were inside the
vehicle. Africanized bees can be extremely aggressive and even deadly
to persons who may have an allergic reaction to their stings. Africanized
bees are spreading across the southwestern United States; see http://

********** 26 July
Retirement Cave, Jamaica
body found in cave
A 73-year-old-man with Alzheimer's disease was missing after he
wandered away from his home on 12 July. On 26 July, a family member
found the man's slippers at the edge of a pit. The man had fallen, or was
pushed, and was 150 feet down in a tight spot, deceased. When the local
fire department could not remove the body, they contacted the Jamaica
Caves Organization. Due to lack of room to maneuver and the body's state
of decomposition, even the cavers could not help. Authorities decided
that the body would be brought out at a later time.

********** 17 August
Lamberts Cave, Minnesota
stranded, injury and aid
"The smoke built up. I was burning everything I could find
down there. I was in and out of consciousness the entire time."
Travis Bungum (18) was looking for Lamberts Cave with friends when
they left him without any gear or supplies. Using only his cell phone and
two lighters to light his way, he fell down the 20-foot-deep entrance shaft.

---------- Page 32 ----------
He somehow managed to get a cell phone signal and call his girlfriend
moments before his battery died. While rescuers searched for the cave,
Bungum said, "I scavenged for whatever I could burn to start a fire for
heat. I was trapped. I was fighting to survive." The fire filled the cave with
smoke and raised the levels of carbon monoxide.
First responders tried to contact local cavers for advice and assis-
tance, but the incident occurred during the weekend of the Minnesota
Speleological Society's annual "Corn Feed" get-together, and all of the
cavers on the call-out list except one were at the event in a deep valley
with no cell phone coverage. The one caver who did not attend had his
phone turned off for the evening. When St. Paul firefighters arrived, they
were able to pull Bungum out without much difficulty.
Bungum was taken to the hospital and treated for a fractured arm,
cuts, bruises, smoke inhalation, and carbon monoxide poisoning.

Nickajack Cave, Tennessee
flooding, aid, no injury
On 12 March, 1963, several southern states were hit simultaneously
with tornados and floods. States affected included Mississippi, Alabama,
Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia. In a summary of the destruction, The
Spokesman-Review mentions that a group of Boy Scouts needed rescuing
from Nickajack Cave. The nine Scouts from Atlanta were trapped by rising
floodwaters but were eventually rescued by the Tennessee Highway Patrol.

Knox Cave, New York
equipment problem, no injury, no aid
Brad Smith (20) was climbing a rope ladder in Knox Cave when it
suddenly became untied at the top. Smith fell 18 feet and landed on his
back. Fortunately, he landed on his pack, which was stuffed with a wetsuit,
and he sustained no injuries. Smith said the incident most likely occurred
due to someone changing the rigging.

Melanie Felker recalls one of her first caving trips with a group of 20
people from Auburn University. Early into the trip, one male twisted his
out, and there are several handlines rigged to trees. In the dark, however,
Bungum did not see the cave and fell in. Building fires in caves is generally
not a good idea and has led to fatalities here in the past.


********** 12 October
Smugglers Cave, California
stranded, injury and aid
Three people who were illegally cliff diving from Sunset Cliffs could
not exit the water due to waves and backwash. They were able to take
refuge in a sea cave known as Smugglers Cave and wait for rescue. With
the tide rising, rescue crews had to rappel to the stranded swimmers. Two
were lifted in harnesses, but one swimmer was injured and was hauled
up in a stretcher.

group leader suggested that Felker, who was the only female on the trip,
stay and "take care of" the patient while everyone else exited the cave to
get help. The leader also took the patient's and Felker's only light sources,
since "they wouldn't need them." Felker and the patient sat in total dark-
ness for more than two hours until the group returned with a handline.
This experience left Felker "not very fond of caves."

Solution Rift, Tennessee
acetylene-related, injury, no aid
In 1995, a group of cavers using carbide lamps was attempting
a
through trip in Solution Rift. At some point during the trip, unbeknownst
to him, Tom Kocher's carbide dump bag leaked in his caving pack, which
also contained his wetsuit. Kocher put his wetsuit on for a particularly wet
section of the cave and then started a 186-foot rappel down Confederate
Well. Partway down the drop, he felt a terrible burning sensation. At the
bottom, he hastily removed his wetsuit to find severe burns covering his
arm. Ron Adams provided him with two nylon football jerseys (Adams's
preferred clothes for caving) since Kocher's caving shirt was also contami-
nated. This incident left Kocher with permanent scarring.

In July of 1996, two young men vandalized a brick wall to gain
entrance to a cave system under Watertown, New York. When their only
flashlight died, they became lost. For the next two days, the men crawled
around (backward to avoid dropoffs), trying to follow the sounds of traf-
fic. They burned $70 worth of bills to light their way, but still could not

found them and led them out, hypothermic and wet. The cave system
was again sealed to prevent future accidents.
This incident escaped the attention of American Caving Accidents in
1996, but a recent occurrence brought it to light. Members of the Niagara
Frontier Grotto recently approached the city of Watertown to request
special permission to survey the caves under the city. During their first
trip in September 2013, cavers discovered a very old wallet containing
a learner's permit for Joseph P. Sweet. The cavers remembered hearing
of two men who had been lost in the caves years before and knew the
wallet must belong to one of them. They contacted Sweet, and his wallet
with all of its contents was returned to him-17 years after he last saw it.

caver fall, injury, no aid
Terry Chambliss (19) was on one of his first caving trips during the
2001 NSS Convention at the Great Saltpeter Preserve. As Chambliss was
about to exit a crawlway, the caver in front of him stood up and stepped
on Chambliss's hand. When Chambliss pulled back, he lost his balance
and slid 15 feet down a mudbank. In the process, he sprained an ankle
and dislocated his left shoulder. His companions helped him out of the
cave, and an EMT on the trip was able to reset his shoulder once they
exited the cave.

********** 3 November 2005
Continental Country Club Bottomless Trash Pit, Arizona
skunk encounter, no injury, no aid
Members of the Northern Arizona Grotto led a number of new
cavers from Northern Arizona University on an introductory caving trip.
The grotto president led the way with three young women following
her. They entered through the cave's small entrance and began working
their way down a 150-foot-deep crevice, using numerous ledges to work
their way down.

Club Bottomless Trash Pit in Arizona after it was accidentally knocked
from its ledge to the bottom of the cave. Photo by Bob Goforth.
Along the way, one of the women dislodged a striped skunk that was
occupying a ledge. The skunk fell on her helmet and then tumbled further
down the passage. The inconvenienced skunk then filled the cave with its
spray. Cavers still at the surface heard screams, which were immediately
followed by the telltale smell of skunk wafting from the entrance. One of
the new cavers happened to be a wildlife biology student who was study-
ing rabid skunks. He entered the cave and removed the skunk.
1. Bob Goforth, e-mail communication, 13 June 2014.
Comments: Striped skunks can spray with incredible accuracy up
to 16 feet. Their spray is a mixture of sulfur-containing chemicals; being
sprayed in the eyes can cause burning and temporary blindness. Skunks
do not generally spray their entire supply the first time and are capable
of spraying multiple times. It is generally unwise to handle wildlife, and
some attempts to "rescue" wildlife from caves can be misguided.


********** 8 November 2009
unspecified cave, Missouri
lost control on rappel, injury, no aid
"Thirty feet is not enough time to react."
Kirsten Alvey-Mudd and five others were visiting caves in Pulaski
County. Their plan was to first visit a cave in a bluff that requires an 80-foot
rappel to access and then to rappel another 30 feet to the base of the
cliff, pull the rope, and hike to other nearby caves.
For the second rappel, Mudd got on rope using a Petzl Stop bobbin-
style rappel device. Although she was more familiar with a rappel rack, she
had used a bobbin at least a dozen times before. When Mudd weighted
the rope, she free-fell to the bottom. Upon hitting the ground, she rolled
another 20 feet to the river's edge and was stopped with a quick snap
when the bobbin caught the knot at the end of the rope. Believing her
injuries to be minor, she encouraged the others to continue with their
trip while she and one other person made their way back to the vehicles,
where they would wait.
When they reached the vehicles, Mudd pulled off her boot to exam-
line her foot. When she removed the SealSkinz sock that she was wearing,
she found her foot soaked in blood and bleeding profusely. Her companion
left a note for the others and drove her to the nearest hospital. Mudd
spent the next nine days in the hospital and has undergone more than
a half-dozen surgeries to repair fractures and a crushed heel and to deal
with vascular complications. She also suffered second- and third-degree
rope burns on both hands.
A later inspection of the bobbin revealed it to be in working order.
Mudd contacted the manufacturer, who suggested that her chest may
have depressed the bobbin's handle, preventing the auto-stop feature
from engaging. Mudd warns that other "bigger-chested" women should
be conscious of this.
1. Kirsten Alvey-Mudd, personal communication, 16 July 2014.
Comments: Mudd was operating the Stop without a braking cara-
biner, which would have created more friction. When using a bobbin-style
rappel device, maximum friction is achieved by pulling upward on the
brake end of the rope against the braking carabiner.

Barton Creek Cave, Belize
fatality, drowning
Barton Creek Cave is a popular tourist cave where the tourist portion
of the cave consists of a canoe ride that goes 0.6 miles into the cave and
then returns by the same route. Each canoe holds either two or three
people, and each person is given a hardhat and a life vest. A 25-person
tour group, organized by Cayo Adventure Tours, was split into four smaller

groups, each with its own guide. At 11:30 a.m., one canoe crashed into
a rock embankment and capsized about 1,200 feet from the entrance of
the cave. Canadian Mildred llene Lines (83), who was not wearing her
hardhat or life vest, drowned. Her canoeing companion was rescued.

Comments: Michael Simmons, owner of Cayo Adventure Tours, said
life vests were offered to all members of the group, but Lines was one
of a few who refused to wear the vest. He said that Lines and the other
occupant of the canoe had paddled ahead of the group against the guide's
instructions. The victim apparently tried to avoid a collision with the walls
of the cave, but when she tried to push herself away from the wall, she
caused the canoe to flip, and she fell into the water.
October 2011
War Eagle Cave, Alabama
difficulty on rope, no injury, no aid
Two groups of cavers met up for a day trip to War Eagle Cave. At the
entrance, two people decided to remain on the surface while four cavers
descended the 120-foot pit. After a short trip downstream, a male and
female caver decided to climb out first. The other two cavers, Glen Kuehner
and Mike Peery, headed upstream while they waited for their turn on rope.
After caving for 45 minutes, Peery and Kuehner returned to the
bottom of the drop and heard shouting. The male caver had ascended
the pit first and was shouting to the female. She was 20 feet off the floor
on a ledge. The echo in the cave made communication difficult. Peery
and Kuehner were able to decipher that she was experiencing a migraine
headache and was attempting to eat to alleviate the symptoms. At this
point the group determined that she would not be able to exit the cave
under her own power.
Getting on rope to ascend to her location did not seem to be a good
option, as the lower weight would pull her from the ledge and possibly
make the situation worse. Peery and Kuehner proceeded to talk her
through a changeover, though communication was difficult due to the
echo. Once on the bottom, the woman was fed and hydrated. Kuehner
climbed out to build a haul system. Peery remained with her to help her
get on rope safely and to provide a tag line to keep her away from the
ledges during ascent.
Kuehner had a small party rope kit with enough gear to create a 9:1
mechanical advantage haul system. The woman's companion argued that
the haul system be changed to a 3:1, and Kuehner eventually conceded.
However, this required the topside cavers to assist with the haul. Rope
pads placed at three significant rub points would not stay in place, and
the friction made the hauling difficult for the four cavers. Inspection of
the Talon rope after the woman was removed from the pit showed signifi-
cant sheath wear, but Peery was able to ascend the pit without incident.

fatality, unknown cause
On the morning of June 14, a dive instructor and his student checked
in at the desk at Ginnie Springs. The student was taking a Basic Cave
(SPAR) response for the incapacitated caver. The equipment needed to

Blue Spring Cave, Tennessee
caver fall, injury, no aid
Donna Cobb (45) and others were heading out of Blue Spring Cave
after an eight-hour trip in the early winter of 2012. As Cobb was exiting
a long crawl, she leaned out to hand her pack to her companion Kelly
Norwood. As she leaned forward, she slipped and began to fall headfirst.
During the 12-foot fall, she somehow managed to flip over and land on
her feet. Norwood described the scene by saying that Cobb "flipped in
mid-air and landed on her feet like a monkey."
Cobb felt like she had sprained her right knee, but she was able to
hobble the rest of the way out of the cave. Later that evening, she wrapped
her knee in an ACETM bandage and iced it down. Two weeks later, she was
still limping, so she went to her doctor for an x-ray. The images showed
she had fractured her tibia. She was on crutches with a soft cast from
mid-thigh to ankle for the next 40 days.
1. Donna K. Cobb, Incident Report, 15 July 2014.

advantage to have the reflexes of a monkey.


********** 12 April 2012
Mill Creek Pit, Tennessee
rockfall, injury, no aid
Michael Tennant (42), Ben Miller, Dan Lamping, Clinton Barber, and
Cody Munday were surveying a 90-foot-deep side pit in Mill Creek Pit.
When Tennant rappelled into the pit, he noticed that the walls appeared to
be unstable. Thirty feet down, after passing through a panhandle-shaped
slot, he heard "the unmistakable crack of rocks popping off the wall."
The slot above him helped protect him from most of the estimated 50
to 80 pounds of rock that fell. However, several rocks did hit him, and he
was knocked upside down while on rope. Attaching his upper ascender
and QAS, he was able to right himself, although this was difficult due to
extensive injuries sustained by his left arm and hand. After performing
a changeover using only one hand, he was able to slowly climb out and
exit the cave unassisted.
1. Michael Tennant, Incident Report, 9 July 2014.
Comments: Changeovers are considered an essential skill for vertical
cavers, because practicing them teaches you how your gear works and
some of the ways that it does not or cannot work. The weight transfers
inherent in a changeover are the building blocks of the skills needed to
cross knots and rebelays and to perform pickoffs. Cavers rarely have to
perform changeovers in real situations, but this incident is a good example
of why you might need to. Tennant was surely familiar with his gear and
how it works, since he was able to safely perform a changeover and climb
out one-handed. Practice pays off.
course, so both he and the instructor were required to sign a student
liability waiver for the site. The two of them did two short training dives
that morning. At about the same time, Shannon Lewis (20) went to a local
dive shop, rented some equipment, and had her tanks filled with 32%
nitrox. She then went to the Ginnie Springs desk and registered there as
a Basic Cave diver.

---------- Page 35 ----------
At the Ginnie Springs site, Lewis met the instructor and his student.
Whether that meeting was planned is in dispute. The instructor was also
Lewis's instructor when she completed her Basic Cave certification the
previous December.
All three divers entered the water near the steps leading to the
springs and completed the standard pre-dive safety drills there. They
then proceeded to the spring known as the Devil's Ear to enter the cave.
The Ear is an opening that descends straight down into the cavern area
to a depth of approximately 50 feet. It then turns toward the cave and
slopes at a gentle angle until it reaches the main line of the cave. The
distance from the chimney to the main line of the cave is about 60 feet,
and the depth at the stop sign is about 70 feet. Near the top of the Ear,
at a depth of about 18 feet (depending upon the level of the river at the
time), a log lies horizontally across the opening. It is regularly used by
divers completing their dives as a resting place to do decompression or
safety stops. Some people refer to it as the deco log.
The student was leading the dive, Lewis was second, and the instruc-
tor was in the rear. The student entered the sloped area and was heading
toward the main line in the cave section when he noticed a flashing light
signal. He turned and saw Lewis pointing to her ear, which normally indi-
cates trouble equalizing the pressure. He returned to the area just outside
the chimney and waited while the instructor accompanied Lewis into the
chimney area. The instructor's computer later indicated that he went to
the base of the chimney area, and he said that he watched Lewis reach
the log above him, where she turned and waved to indicate that he could
go. The instructor and student then continued with their training dive.
When the instructor and student were done with the dive, they
surfaced to find that Lewis had been found by others unresponsive at
the log and had been taken to the hospital. Police activity ensued, as the
investigation began and statements were taken. During this time, police
opened Lewis's car and found that she was taking prescription medica-
tions for inner ear infections in both ears. After a number of days in the
hospital, Lewis died.
Previously Unreported Caving-Related Incidents
4 February, 2004
Hutchinsons Hole, Jamaica
fatality, fell into pit
In early January of 2004, the Jamaican Caves Organization (JCO) was
contacted by a landowner about exploring a deep cave on the landowner's
property. In the initial e-mail, the landowner casually mentioned that there
was a rumor of a body in the cave. The JCO was interested in visiting the
cave but suggested that the landowner first contact the police. The police
claimed that firefighters had already rappelled more than 500 feet into
the cave and still could not see the bottom. The JCO highly questioned
this, as they knew the cave (which is well known for historical reasons)
to be closer to 325 feet deep.
In case they did encounter a body, the JCO tried to procure a body
bag. The police did not have any, and a funeral home would give them
one only if it was granted the funeral business. The cavers did not really
expect to find a body, so they did not pursue this.
On 1 February, cavers Ivor Conolley, Mark Bellinger, Delroy Williams,
and Ronald Stefan Stewart assembled at the entrance to the cave. Crowd
control quickly became an issue as dozens, then hundreds of spectators
gathered around the entrance pit. Stewart rappelled first, and 60 feet
from the bottom, he knew that there was in fact a body in the bottom.
While trying to overcome nausea from the smell, Stewart waited for
Conolley to join him. The body of Carlton Rose had probably been in the
cave for three months.
At the request of the police, the cavers removed a piece of evidence
for identification purposes. However, they were unable to remove the
body with the equipment on hand. They returned on 4 February with
a body bag (supplied by a funeral home) and brought Rose's remains to

2. This report was researched and written by John Adsit, who interviewed
several persons involved with this incident, including the dive instructor,
the student, the dive shop owner, and an expert witness.
Comments: This incident has created a heated debate among the
cave-diving community. Some claim that Lewis was a student of the
instructor at the time of the accident and that he should therefore be liable
for making sure she exited the water safely. An instructor with a student
has a very different responsibility legally than an instructor diving with a
certified diver who is tagging along. According to her certification dates

equipment problem, no injury, no aid
Christina Richards was helping to survey Guy James Cave when she
experienced a problem with her right regulator. A defective O-ring on the
regulator's swivel unexpectedly caused free-flowing bubbles to envelop
her face. She describes the event as, "Suddenly it was like being under-
water in a hot tub, on high." When she began to panic, her dive buddy
assisted and helped her switch to her left regulator. The swivel was later
recalled due to many incidents of a similar nature.

fatality, suicide
A man in his 20s was part of a tour group visiting Sótano de las
Guaguas in the state of San Luis Potosí, Mexico. The man exited the tour
bus, milled around a bit, then took off running toward the sótano, not
slowing down until he hit the bottom. The body recovery was done by
Cesario Cadillo and his group of cave guides. Cadillo is the local authority
and guide for the area. Someone took gory photos of the body and then
sold the photos to Mexican equivalents of the National Inquirer magazine.
This put cave-rescue personnel in a bad light, as they were appearing to
profit from the incident.

Comments: Cave-rescue personnel have been given bad publicity in
the U.S. after someone naively talked with the media. Only designated
information officers should speak with the media concerning rescue
events.

well supplied medic with appropriate proto-

a patient rehydrate SO that he can leave

If this is not feasible, then fluid may have to

is just as heavy as water bottle fluids. By
the time a called-out rescue is in progress,
a dehydrated patient is going to need a lot
of fluid. Getting IV access will be challeng-
ing even for the experienced medic. By the
time a rescue team has been called in, the
chances of hypothermia are high if it has
not been actively prevented. Rapidly infused
cave-temperature IV fluid has the potential to
drop core temperature even more. Warming
IV fluid to an appropriate temperature under-
ground is tricky.
Although IV fluid given underground
can save lives, it won't arrive quickly, SO the
best strategy is to work hard at preventing
dehydration. Take enough water when you
cave. Drink water, even when you don't want
to. Plan to include pee bottles as a normal
part of your caving gear, and be prepared
to deal with them when filled up. Match
your layers to your anticipated activity level.
Include antinausea and antidiarrhea medi-
cines appropriate for you in your first aid
kit. Stay hydrated, and stay safe.

USING SAFE TECHNIQUES TO PREVENT
CAVER FALLS
Most experienced cavers are already
familiar with common techniques to prevent
caver falls. Indeed, most of us will consider
the information presented here to be
common sense. However, novice cavers are
likely to be unfamiliar with how to prepare
for a trip and how to safely and efficiently
move through a cave. Beginner and inter-
mediate cavers may know some of the
techniques and best practices for safe caving,
but they may lack the experience to know
how and when to use them or when to turn
back if not properly prepared.
Trip leaders may find the suggestions
presented here to be useful when leading
trips with novice cavers. If you are such a
leader, you may want to review this informa-
tion before your trips and share appropriately
with the participants.
BEFORE THE TRIP
Match cave trip objectives to partici-
pant experience and ability.
Well before the day of the trip, consider
the cave and the objectives of the trip, and
choose participants with the appropriate
experience, ability, and equipment. It can
be very difficult to tell someone they aren't
able to go on a trip; however, consider the
consequences of not achieving the trip's
objectives, or worse, the consequences of
an accident or injury.
Use appropriate personal gear and
attire.
Clothing and extra layers appropriate

Strangers would look at him with amaze-

Caving News and other sources posted
the sad story of two Spanish cavers dying
after falling into a canyon during a caving
expedition to Morocco. Gustavo Virues
died in the fall and Jose Antonio Martinez
survived with a head injury. How they fell was
not explained. Fellow caver, Juan Bolivar,
attended Martinez for six days until two
Moroccan gendarmes arrived and sent down
a stretcher on a rope. Martinez was placed
in the stretcher and the two Moroccans then
tried to pull him up by hand. However, the
stretcher somehow stopped under an icy
waterfall, and the gendarmes tied him off
there and left the scene. Bolivar then listened
to his friend's cries for help that night as he
slowly drowned in the frigid water. It was
over two hours before rescuers from the
Civil Protection of Morocco arrived and
hauled him up, dead by then. Bolivar was
then instructed to walk downhill for four
hours to a goat track, which he followed to
a village where he was treated. Spain said it
had offered on April 3 to send a plane with
a team of experts to Morocco but only got
permission to send the rescuers two days
later. Martinez' friends believe his death
is a homicide due to negligence and have
initiated legal action: tinyurl.com/mm861r4.
The Walker Mountain Tunnel blog of
the Walker Mountain Grotto contains a
report by Bill Grose on the bat count trip
led by Ken Walsh to Hancock Cave, Smyth
County, Virginia, on March 7. Walsh has
been conducting the counts for several years,
and this time was joined by Grose, Jason
Lachniet, Zachary Taylor, LeeAnn Mullins,
and Emily Graham. They found five tricol-
ored bats and one big brown bat, the latter
being the first that Walsh has seen in this cave
(tinyurl.com/o6es2bp). That's three fewer
than were seen in the 2014 count, according
to Emily Lachniet in a Triangle Troglodyte
trip report: tritrogs.blogspot.com/.

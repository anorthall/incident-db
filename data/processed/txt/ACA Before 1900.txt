CAVE ACCIDENTS BEFORE 1900
by Angelo 1. George
Cave exploration is not without some danger that in many ways is related to the skill of the
explorer. Most of the pre-1900 cave accidents revolve around the loss of light. There are no
examples of people actually getting "lost" in caves. In most cases, cavers usually get lost only in
the mind of the rescue party or the newspaper press. There are four tragic accidents of death
and several involve an encounter with foul air in caves. Several of the accidents are obvious
hoaxes. Most of the accidents occurred in mineral exploitation caves or caves opened to tourism.
Robert Montgomery Bird (1837, p. 434-435) gives us a hint of even more cave accidents
during the saltpeter mining era (1808-1815) than heretofore known. He says:
cave hunting, in fact became a kind of mania, beginning with speculation, and
ending with hair-brained young men, who dared from the love of adventure the
risks that others ran for profit. As might be expected, this passion was not always
indulged without accident; and several caves in Kentucky and Tennessee
obtained a mournful celebrity as the scenes of painful suffering and
disaster Accidents, not attended with loss of life, were of frequent occurrence;
and as for frights, they were lumped together in report, in the style of a constable's
inventory, as too tedious to mention.
The cave guides at Mammoth Cave would recite horror stories of people getting lost in
Mammoth Cave or killed in nearby caves. The stories served two functions: (1) it entertained
their charges; and (2) kept the party together from individually straying down side passages.
Grateful acknowledgment is extended to Mr. Marion O. Smith, Mr. Thomas J. Metzgar, and
William R. Halliday, M. D., for fruitful insight and original accounts. I am especially grateful to Dr.
Trevor R. Shaw, the dean of European spelean history for his enquiry into American cave
accidents prior to the year 1900.
Over thirty cave accidents have been abstracted from a cursory examination of the literature.
This is by far not a complete inventory. The most recent cave name followed by its synonym is
used in these accident report.
Woodland 445 B.C.
Mammoth Cave, Edmonson County, Kentucky.
The mummified American Indian, Lost John was found on Mummy Ledge on June 7,
1935. He was a selenite miner about 45 years old, who was crushed to death by a six ton
boulder (Robbins, 1974, p. 139; Munson et al., 1989, p. 129). The Indian had under mined a
large boulder in search of selenite. During the process, the boulder teetered over and crushed
him to death. Lost John has the distinction of being the first known casualty in an American cave.
Adena 10 B.C. to 30 A.D.
Salts Cave, Edmonson County, Kentucky.
The mummified American Indian, Little AI (a.k.a. Little Alice) died in a side passage off of
Mummy Valley. He was 9 years old when he expired (Robbins, 1974, p. 140, 142). Robbins
(1974, p. 144) said "that the burial of Little AI was the most recent prehistoric activity in the cave.
He "died rather suddenly from an internal hemorrhage resulting from a fall or blow to the thoracic
area." The body was recovered in 1875. This was not an Indian burial, rather after the accident,
Little Al was prepped for burial by his Indian companions and laid to rest on a ledge off of
Mummy Valley.
C. 1760

Israel Putnam and hunting party chased a wolf into a small pit like cave near Pomfret.
Putnam tied a rope about his legs and then crawled downward into the cave. By kicking his feet,
a signal would be transmitted along the rope back to the surface party with instructions to haul
him out of the hole. Misread signals caused the surface party to pull him out on two false
occasions. He experienced brushed elbows and knees. The final extraction confirmed his wolf
kill. (Humphreys, 1788; Perry, 1946, p. 28-31).
Winter (?) 1798
Great Saltpetre Cave, Rockcastle County, Kentucky.
John Baker discovers the great cave on Crooked Creek. Enters with wife and two or three
children. Used hand held wood splinter torch. Wife carries extra fuel supply. Goes about 400-500
yards into the cave from the north entrance (then the only one known), drops his torch, there by
extinguishing the flame. For two days and two nights they remained in darkness with no other
provisions. Mrs. Baker groped her way out of the cave by feeling wet muddy foot prints left by the
exploring party. All emerged safely (Brown, 1809, p. 237).
Cave, St. Louis County, Missouri.
L. R. Lorimer (1828) recalled a secret solo hallucinatory cave trip he experienced as a
young married adult. While in the cave, he wants to collect a rock formation. He achieved this by
taking another rock and used it as a battering ram. This activity initiated a rock fall that sealed his
exit way to the entrance, After what seemed like three days, he suffered cold, fatigued, and
practically had given up all hope. Then a rain storm commenced. The inwash from the storm
poured through the break above the roof collapse. This process opened up into a sinkhole on the
surface. In the morning he could see the sun shining through the fresh opening. The article is
written in a melodramatic style and reads as a work of fiction or hoax.
Pre-January 21, 1810.
Mammoth Cave, Edmonson County, Kentucky.
The Sick Room received its name because the first explorer "first felt a nausea and
general debility, which was succeeded by violent puking we supposed the existence of mephitic
gas " (Anon., 1810). Exploration and tourism generally avoided this passage in the cave.
Summer 1811
Longs (Wrights, Grand Avenue) Cave, Edmonson County, Kentucky.
A saltpeter speculator, Mr. Wright in the company of an inexperienced miner explored
Longs Cave. Deep into the cave, their only candle burned low and then went out. Their main
supply had been left at the cave entrance. They proceeded to grope their way in the wrong
direction down a side passage flanked by deep pits. By throwing stones ahead of their travel, the
pits could possibly be circumvented. Wright in the lead, fell head long into one of the deeper
shafts. The miner called to Wright, but there was no answer. The miner (who already suspected
they were traveling in the wrong direction) turned in the opposite direction and made it out of the
cave. This was a cleaver feat, especially since the pit is located over 1350 feet from the
entrance, opens into a huge trunk passage with at least two major side passages. He made it
back to Mammoth Cave to summoned a rescue party. Wrights dead body was recovered from a
50-60 feet deep pit (Farnham, 1820, p. 359; Bird, 1837, p. 436-437).
pre 1814
Mammoth Cave, Edmonson County, Kentucky.
A black slave saltpeter miner in the lower reaches of Gothic Avenue (Haunted Chambers)
is missed by his companions. He tries to make his way out, only to stumble and fall, there by
extinguishing his light. He starts to hallucinate that there were devils in the cave bent on
tormenting him. His very rescuers were perceived to be these very devils (Bird, 1837, p. 539-
530). The passage became known as the Haunted Chambers and only later change to Gothic
Avenue about 1845. From 1810 (Anon.) until Bird (1837), the Haunted Chambers received its
name from the echo produced in several parts of the avenue. The lost slave in the "haunted"
avenue may be a manufactured story by Mammoth Cave management.

Pre August 6, 1823
Hinman's Hole, Massachusetts.
A deep pit was discovered and on three separate descents foul air was encountered at
14, 20, and 30 feet below the lip. C. W. Smith made the deepest penetration; his candle would
not burn at the 30 foot level and had difficulty in breathing. The air got better at greater depths
(Anon. 1823) Carbon dioxide levels probably were in the 3% range or greater.
December 1828
Half Moon Mountain Cave, Gallatin County, Illinois.
An exploration party of sixteen from the Saline Salt Works explored a nearby cave. Deep
in the cave they encountered a foul air environment that put their candle out. A hasty retreat was
made. "The effect on the man who held the candle, was a giddiness of the head, with sickness
and plucking; but on an immediate application of cold water, he soon recovered." They were
about 3/4 of a mile from the entrance. They encountered on the way out, two of their party sitting
in total darkness. They had let their candle fall and could not relight it (S.C.C., 1830). Carbon
dioxide levels were probably in the 5% range or higher.
n.d., pre 1833
Grand Caverns (Amens, Weyer's, Weir's, Grottoes of the Shenandoah),
Augusta County, Virginia.
A French gentleman (M. Suntag) and the cave guide (Mr. Mohler) candle went out while
in the cave. The guide knew the cave well enough that he escorted the Frenchman out of the
cave to the light of day. They were 500 feet from the entrance at a place that would be
commemorated as The Frenchman's Hill or Suntag's Hill (Cooke, 1840, 45; Suntag in Anon.,
1849).
Spring 1833
Grand Caverns (Amens, Weyer's, Weir's, Grottoes of the Shenandoah),
Augusta County, Virginia.
Robert L. Cooke, his brother and cave guide explored a pit off of Congress Hall called the
Infernal Regions. The pit received its name "for many years it has been supposed to contain fixed
air, so that visitors avoid it." The exploration party descended about 29 feet to a ledge where the
effects of carbon dioxide started to take its toll on the group. Their candles started to burn dimly
and four of them went out. They "experienced no difficulty in breathing, or any other indication of
the presence of this much dreaded gas." And "when we emerged from the pit into which we had
first entered, our candles again shone brightly." Cooke (1840, p. 45). Carbon dioxide levels in the
3% range.
n.d., pre 1835
Grand Caverns (Amens, Weyer's, Weir's, Grottoes of the Shenandoah),
Augusta County, Virginia.
A man by the name of Patterson upon hearing of the exploits of the Frenchman in the
cave of darkness, wanted to duplicate the adventure. He proceeded alone from the Ball Room
toward the entrance without light. Ascending the steps at the end of the room, he slipped and fell
"into an aperture, where he lay unhurt." His friends returned when he did not show up at the
entrance. They rescued him from the area that would become known as Patterson's Grave
(Cooke, 1840, p. 45).
Mammoth Cave, Edmonson County, Kentucky.
Charles F. Harvey (nephew of Franklin Gorin, owner of the cave) was "lost" for 39 hours.
He went down a cave passage and experienced light failure, and there he remained. A large
search party was assembled from locals in the vicinity of the cave. When they found him, "he
was almost wild" (Shackleford, n.d., p. 5). The passage today is now known as Harvey Way.
Substance connected with this event added to guide patter on the lore of the cave. Especially
horror stories of people getting "lost" and going "mad" in the cave.

County, Virginia.
One third of a mile into the cave, the guide would extinguished their torches and thereby
give his charges the experience of perpetual night. The guide had axillary matches in which to
relight the torches. Wet matches prevented the relighting of their lights. Several ladies and
gentlemen remained in total darkness for an hour or more until the guide returned with fresh
torches (Anon., 1849). Apparently, the extinguishing of the lights was a common entertainment
trick preformed by the management in this commercial cave.


********** November 7, 1848
Mammoth Cave, Edmonson County, Kentucky.
Mary Loving Bliss of Buffalo, New York, on her wedding trip is killed by a rock fall in
Mammoth Cave (Dolbee, 1948).
December 1848
Penn's Cave, Centre County, Pennsylvania.
Two lovers while exploring Penn's Cave experienced light failure. They were unable to
relight their torches and remained in the cave for three days. Their hungry horses were
discovered at the cave entrance by a passing farmer who reasoned someone may be in the cave
(Folson, 1956, p. 198). This account may be more folklore than a real event.
Winter pre 1851
Wyandotte Cave, Crawford County, Indiana.
Three brothers by the name of Kesner and a neighbor boy by the name of Byerly entered
the Old Cave on Sunday morning. While there their candles went out. They had left their auxiliary
candles in their coat pockets deposited near the cave entrance. At 3 o'clock Monday morning,
"old man Kesner" went to George Sibert's house to enquire about his sons. By 4 o'clock, Sibert
and Kesner had found the stranded explorers in the cave. The boys were "about starved to
death." The boys though they had been in the cave for three days. Actually they had been in the
cave for only eighteen hours (Rothrock, 1915).
September 1858
Mammoth Cave, Edmonson County, Kentucky.
William C. Prentice was being pulled out of the Maelstrom when the rope caught fire from
the friction produced over the beam used to support the rope. The fire was put out with water
from a bottle. This was a serious moment, for Prentice was 100 feet from the floor and 90 feet
from the top where the fire occurred (Anon., 1858).
Spring(?) 1856
General A. W. G. Davis's farm, Greenbrier County, West Virginia.
A young man was plowing a field when a catastrophic sinkhole opened up and he and his
horse fell 150 feet into a cave stream. The horse was killed. For 48-hours he wandered down
stream in pitch blackness, pushed through a 30 foot long full syphon into more air filled cave. He
finally reached the spring cave entrance at a distance of 6 miles from where the sinkhole had
opened (Anon., 1870). Story has a high degree of improbability.
Bell's Tavern Cave, Barren County, Kentucky.
During the Civil War, Cyrus C. Hodges injured in cave by rock fall while looking for water.
Was taken to a hospital in Louisville for recuperation. He was discharged for this disability from
the Union Army on July 16, 1862.
Pre April 8, 1866
Dead Man's Cave, Crawford County, Indiana.
Lyman E. Knapp was lowered into a pit where he was bitten by a bat on the face. Upon
extraction he nearly fainted. In going through a small orifice, portly E. R. Hawn, M.D., became
stuck for three hours. Going back to their boat on Blue River for a crowbar, their lamps began to
run low on oil. It began to look grim for all involved. The party panicked and left Knapp and the
stuck doctor in the cave. Knapp could not get out because the doctor blocked the way. The
cavers returned to Leavenworth for tools, lamps, oil and a larger rescue party. In the mean time,

---------- Page 5 ----------
Knapp had found a sinkhole exit to the surface after being in the cave for 56 hours. He was found
wandering in the woods by a hunter. The where about of Dr. Hawn was unknown (Anon. 1866a).
Apparently Hawn made it out alive because we next see the rotund fellow at the Wyandotte Cave
4th of July lawn and cave party.
Pre 1866
Bear Cave, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.
"A number of years ago a lady from Pittsburg lost herself in this cave, and being unable to
regain the course to the mouth, perished; her whitened bones were found a few years afterward
by
an exploring party She had probably entered the cave unguided, and thus unthinkingly
subjected herself to an awful death by starvation." (Anon., 1866b). Thomas J. Metzgar (personal
oral communication, 5 September 1992) could find no conformation for the "whitened bones" in
the cave. He thought the story is a concocted romantic hoax. After all, bleached white bones is a
terrestrial phenomena and not one in a dark cave, away from sun light.


********** April 5, 1873
Hannibal Cave, Marion County, Missouri.
Five boys explore one of the complex maze caves recently opened up during quarry
operations. They ran out of string to mark the way and used up all their candles. They waited for
fifteen hours before a rescue party from the town found them.


********** October 21, 1875
Bear Cave, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.
Two youths by the name of J. Herron and Anderson experienced light failure while
exploring the complex maze cave on Thursday. A rescue party from the town entered the cave at
9 A.M. on Friday, and with in two hours Herron and Anderson were rescued from their dark
confinement (Anon. 1875).
Spring 1878
Wyandotte Cave, Crawford County, Indiana.
Biologist, David Starr Jordan is separated from a party of twelve or fifteen and is lost in
the south end of the cave (Rothrock, 1915). Starr had parted company with his caver friends and
was exploring alone beyond the Australian Continent. He realized this part of the cave was new
to him, so he sat down to wait for his companions who he could hear in the distant. In a short
time he went to sleep. Awaking, he could not hear anyone and then ran in the direction of the last
voices. In the process, his candle went out. He sat down in hopes he would be discovered.
Edward T. Cox, the State Geologist of Indiana was in the same cave exploring party and
suggested they all go top side and have dinner. Perhaps Jordan will catch up, they thought,
because Jordan knew the cave better than anybody. After dinner Cox and party returned to the
cave and found him cold, shivering, and had the appearance of having been beat up. The site is
now known as Jordan's Wait. Jordan had been in this part of the cave from about 10 A.M. to 1
P.M.


********** July 27, 1879
Lost River Cave, Warren County, Kentucky.
W. H. Phillips, "Bud" Coombs, John Bailey, J. B. Sumpter, and an African America were a
half a mile back in the water cave when they heard a high water surge coming from the cave
entrance. The mill gates had been opened to start the mill wheel. The cavers were knocked
down by the surge wave and carried along with the high water. They lost their lights and
sustained body bruises. They made their way out of the cave in pitch blackness (Anon., 1879).
Pre 1882
Mammoth Cave, Edmonson County, Kentucky.
Matt Bransford, a freed slave guide, hid from some dirk revelers who had partook too
much wine and were in rare spirits for mischief. Matt extinguished his light. After they had past
his hiding spot, he tried to relight his lamp, but had forgotten his matches. With care, he made
his way out of the Bottomless Pit area along a trail he knew well, all the while feeling his way with
his staff. Then his staff detected one of the chasms; he stopped, became dizzy, and fainted at

the edge of the drop off. He came to, adjusted his composure, and crawled along the path,
feeling with his hands. In this fashion he made it back to the surface (Hovey, 1882, p. 121).
Pre 1883
Bear Cave, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.
A rain storm occurred during the exploration of this complex maze cave. The cavers
witness the cave stream on the rise. This caused some consternation, and one of the ladies in
the party fainted. She was revived and all exited the cave safely (Anon., 1883).


********** March 16, 1884
Lookout Mountain Cave, Hamilton County, Tennessee.
Two men, Charles Gower and Christopher Schmitzins were 2 1/2 miles back into the
cave when Gower stumbled, dropped his lantern in a crevice and broke their bottle of reserve oil.
Groped around without any luck and they finally sat down to await a rescue. They were thought
by the gate keeper to have already exited the cave while he was at dinner. Two weeks later
another exploration party accidently discovered them in the cave (Anon., 1884).


********** November 21, 1885
Lisamby Cave, Caldwell County, Kentucky.
John Verhoeff in the company of two or three boys and several young ladies went cave
exploring on Saturday morning. Young Verhoeff chose to explore a side passage on his own.
While in there his candle had only two inches left and finally went out. His companions called to
him from the main cave without any answer. They became concerned and exited the cave to call
out a rescue party. A 100 man rescue party was assembled just after dark at the cave entrance.
After four hours of searching, they found him perched atop of a 20 foot high rock. How he got up
there no one could guess. "Mr. Verhoeff was brought into town amidst the cheers of the people,
and escorted in a torchlight procession to the College, and there, after he had publically thanked
the crowd for his delivery, they left him." (Anon. 1885, p. 2).
C. 1880-1900
Mammoth Cave, Edmonson County, Kentucky.
Cave guide Ed Bishop had four of his party disappear from the group. They went on their
own exploration of Mammoth Cave. Their lights went out all but one. They sat down and awaited
to be rescued. After finishing work for the day he went back into the cave in search of his lost
charges. He found them at one o'clock in the morning (Jeffers, 1918, p. 155).
pre-1897
Mammoth Cave, Edmonson County, Kentucky.
Cave guides Nick and Mat Bransford save a tour group from drowning on Echo River in
Mammoth Cave (Wright in Schmitzer, 1993, p. 243; I have not seen the Wright reference).

Introduction
Bill Putnam
Welcome to the long-awaited 1994-1995 issue of
American Caving Accidents. In this issue you will find 148
accident and safety incident reports. During the review
process, some members of the review committee asked me
why certain minor incidents were included for publication.
The incidents in question were those which resulted in minor
injury or inconvenience, but had no serious consequence. I
would like to take a few moments to discuss the purpose of
this publication, as I see it. As I do, I believe my reasons for
including these minor incidents will become clear.
American Caving Accidents is not just an exercise in
record keeping. It serves several purposes for the Society.
Yes, it is the primary record of caving accidents in North
America. That is a valuable service which the Society
provides. But my discussions with cavers over 17 years of
caving, and over the last year as I prepared this publication,
have convinced me that this record keeping role is not the
most important function of the publication.
Many cavers have said to me that ACA is the most
useful publication they receive from the NSS. They feel this
way because they recognize the benefits to their own caving
abilities and activities to be gained from reading about the
accidents, incidents, near-misses, and close calls described in
these pages. They realize that this publication presents them
with the opportunity to learn from the mistakes or misfortunes
of their fellow cavers.
When I began caving in 1980, I was fortunate to have
several good friends who acted as mentors, teaching me safe
caving techniques, instructing me in the importance of cave
conservation, and introducing me into the community of
cavers. These cavers told me dozens of stories around the
campfire, or over dinner, or on the long drives to and from the
caves. In the process, they passed on to me the collective
experience of many, many cavers, gained over decades of
active caving. What they were doing, whether they realized it
or not, was fulfilling their roles as "elders of the tribe".
You know what I mean. We may not want to admit
it, but we all get older. Some of us get a little wiser in the
process. Eventually, we realize that those new cavers look
pretty young. Years ago, when there weren't SO many of us
(and of them) we knew them all and we took them into our
ranks and under our wings, teaching them how to cave
without hurting themselves, their friends, or the caves.
Today, the caving community is SO large that we can
not know everyone. My own grotto is SO large that there are
quite a few folks I may never cave with or get to know. Years
ago I helped teach vertical training sessions. In the course of a
day on the cliffs or on a training trip I would regale my
captive audience with tales of close calls, nasty injuries, near
misses, rescues, and fatal accidents. I wanted them to
understand the consequences of rockfall in a pit, rigging the
rack backwards, losing control of a rappel, or wearing a cheap
hard-hat. I believed then (and I still do) that you have to have
some way to take the abstract rules of safety and technique
and personalize them, in order to really understand and
appreciate them. You have to know the story behind or
beyond the rules.
American Caving Accidents is part of what my friend
Dave Hughes likes to call "the pool of archival knowledge". It
is a collection of shared experiences that can help the reader
connect the abstract rules and techniques found in books or
imparted by teachers with the real world of caving that we all
experience. When we read about the caver who dropped his
only light down the pit and became stranded, or the one whose
climbing helmet saved his life, we remember the stories. The
phrases "three sources of light" and "cheap hard-hats are for
cheap heads" have more meaning.
Almost 18 years later, I clearly remember many of
the stories I was told by my mentors. Most were hair-raising
tales of near-misses. Nobody got hurt, and they all laughed
about it later, but they knew (and I learned) just how close
they were to death or serious injury. These near-miss stories
were every bit as important in my training as the stories of
serious accidents. They taught me that inattention,
miscommunication, and mistakes can happen to anyone - no
matter how experienced. And they taught me that there is only
a split second and one bad decision separating an enjoyable
caving trip from tragedy.
American Caving Accidents is a teaching tool. It's a
communication channel. It is a way for us to pass on to the
new cavers the collective experience and wisdom of the tribe.
We can't take all the new cavers out caving, or share stories
around the fire with them. But we can publish our experiences
for them to read. In the process, perhaps we will remind
ourselves of important lessons that we have forgotten.
Eventually, I acquired responsibilities which limited
my caving time. I became reluctant to devote precious caving
weekends to teaching the new cavers. I wanted to spend the
time that I had on fun things, like mapping and exploration,
project caving, and SO on. I wanted to spend that time with my
old buddies, not with strangers. So I stopped leading the
beginner trips and teaching the training sessions.
But I still like to tell the stories, on trips and around
the campfire. I present programs to my grotto on safety and
techniques. I have become involved in cave rescue work.
When the opportunity arises, I try to be a good mentor to
some of the new cavers that I meet.
I realize that I owe a great debt to my mentors. Steve
Attaway, Ed Strausser, Buddy Lane, and many others taught
me things that have kept me alive and caving. But the debt I
owe is payable, not to them, but to the new generations of
cavers. We all owe that debt.
Reading ACA is a great way for all cavers, not just
new ones, to build knowledge and awareness of safe caving
practices. But it is still up to each one of us to teach and
promote safety at every meeting and on every trip.
How will you meet your responsibility as one of the
elders of the caving tribe?

Overview of the 1994 and 1995 Reports
Following the example of previous issues of
American Caving Accidents, the reports have been separated
into two general categories: regular caving and cave diving,
and then further classified by result or outcome and by causes
and contributing factors. I have introduced one new category,
"difficulty on rope", which encompasses such problems as
becoming stuck at the lip of a pit, clothing or hair caught in
the rappel device, jammed rappel safety, or simply becoming
unable to ascend of descend. My intent is to better describe
these situations, which might otherwise be lumped under
"stuck", "trapped/stranded", or perhaps "equipment problem".
At first glance, it may appear that the number of 1994
incidents is alarmingly large compared to previous years. I
believe that the high number is due to the long period between
this issue of ACA and the previous one. The extra time for
gathering reports has probably inflated the total number of
incidents. The number of serious incidents (those involving
fatalities, injuries, or aid) is less than in 1993, and the numbers
for fatalities and incidents resulting in injury and aid are also
smaller than in 1993.
For similar reasons, it is also possible that the 1995
numbers are somewhat understated. If so, I hope that
additional reports for 1995 can be obtained and published in
the next issue along with the 1996 and 1997 reports.
In reporting the number of incidents versus NSS
membership totals, only the serious incidents were used. The
reader should also be aware that the members of the society
make up only a portion of the population of active cavers.
Incident Results
Fatalities
There were two incidents that resulted in fatalities in
1994. The only reported caving fatality occurred in Caballo
Cave, New Mexico, when a caver was killed by the collapse
of a large rock slab. Another fatality occurred when a man
drove into a sinkhole which had formed in a highway. It is
included in the reports and treated as an "outside" incident.
In 1995 there were two fatal accidents reported. One
occurred in Real Well, Tennessee, when a novice caver
became stranded on rope in a wet pit and died of hypothermia.
The caver was not properly equipped or clothed for wet
vertical caving. The second fatality occurred when a solo
caver apparently became lost and stranded in Black Cave,
Arizona. His body was discovered 20 months later. Solo
caving is not recommended, especially when no one knows
where you are.
Injury and Aid
The number of incidents involving injury and aid has
shown a slow growth in past years. It was good to see the
number decline slightly after a peak in 1993. Many of the
incidents were resolved by the caving parties themselves
without a callout for rescue.
Aid (no injury)
The majority of these incidents are rescues of
individuals that cavers often refer to as "spelunkers". They are
typically poorly equipped and inexperienced, and are often
stranded when they break or lose their flashlights, run out of
batteries, or get lost. In several notable cases, however, large
rescue operations were called out for experienced cavers who
were stranded as a result of poor technique or poor judgment.
The easy availability (via 911) of well trained and equipped
cave rescue teams may have encouraged some cavers to hit
the panic button when they could and probably should have
performed a self-rescue.
Injury (no aid)
These incidents resulted in injuries ranging from
scrapes and bruises to sprained ankles and broken fingers. In
each case, the victim was able to exit the cave with minimal
assistance from members of the caving party.
No Consequence
Many of these incidents are of the "near miss"
category. They are included SO that the reader will be aware of
the many things that can go wrong.
Incident Causes
Acetelyne Hazard or Explosion
There were three acetylene hazard incidents in 1994
and none in 1995. One of the three resulted in an explosion,
but did not cause any injury.
Bad Air
Two of the 1994 incidents and two in 1995 involved
bad air in caves. In two cases, cavers equipped with oxygen
cylinders were attempting to enter a pit known to have bad air.
This is extremely dangerous and should not be attempted
without special equipment and training. Supplementary
oxygen cylinders are no substitute for self contained breathing
apparatus (SCBA) air packs. See Bill Elliot's article in this
issue for an excellent discussion of bad air in caves.
Caver Fall
Caver falls remain the leading cause of accident and
injury. The reported causes and contributing factors include
rope failure (a manila rope), out of control rappel, poor
footwear, free-climbing without belay, free-climbing with
ascender safety, and climbing rope hand-over-hand. In several
cases, the victims were not wearing helmets or were wearing
cheap hard-hats with elastic chin-straps, resulting in head
injuries. A proper caving helmet with an inelastic quick-
release chin-strap is the fundamental piece of equipment for
all cavers.
Drowning
There were no drowning incidents in 1994 or 1995,
though there was one close call when a caver was pulled
under by a waterlogged equipment bag during a swim.
Equipment Problem
This catch-all category includes bolt hanger failure,
ascenders slipping on icy ropes, ascender slippage due to
worn cams, light failure, sinking rafts, waterlogged packs,
rope failure, and misuse or lack of equipment.

Incidents
Flooding
There was one flood entrapment in
1994 in Cueva del Brinco, Mexico, when
several experienced cavers were trapped for
two days. They waited it out and exited with
no damage done. In contrast, the Barberry
Cave, Virginia, incident in 1995 drew
national media attention. Simultaneous flood
entrapments in Salamander Cave and
Trapdoor Cave, Indiana, also drew a large
response from rescuers and the media. As in
most flooding incidents, there was little
choice but to wait for the water level to
recede. One close call was reported in 1995
when cavers made a hasty exit from
Foglepole Cave, Illinois, as a flash flood
developed.
Hypothermia
Hypothermia is usually a secondary
result in the reported incidents, occurring
subsequent to cavers becoming injured,
stranded, or trapped in a cave. In 1995 it
proved fatal for a caver in Real Well,
Tennessee, when he became stranded on rope
in a waterfall. Hypothermia was also a factor
in the 1994 rescues at Fern Cave, Alabama,
and Pinnacle Cave, Nevada. Remember:
hypothermia can kill.
Illness
There were two incidents involving
histoplasmosis following the 1994 NSS
convention in Texas. Several cavers were
hospitalized as a result. One caver was on a
multi-day expedition to a remote area in
Lechuguilla when he became ill. He was able
to exit, but was soon hospitalized. There was
also one incident involving an insulin
imbalance reaction in Sotano de San
Augustin, Mexico. It was resolved when a
doctor in the caving party provided
treatment.
Lost
Most of these incidents involved
untrained and ill-equipped cavers with little
experience. Notable exceptions involving
experienced NSS cavers include the incident
at Stolen Well, Alabama, and one of the
Sloans Valley Cave, Kentucky, incidents.
One incident at Gage Cave, New York, also
involved experienced cavers who took a
wrong turn and became stranded by water.
Rockfall
Rockfall remains a major source of
accidents and incidents, causing one fatality
in Caballo Cave, New Mexico, in 1994 and
several serious injuries. Rockfall also
accounts for a large number of the "near-
miss" incidents.

---------- Page 6 ----------
Stuck
Despite popular perception, getting stuck is not much
of a hazard in caving. There were two minor incidents in 1994
in Snow Hole, Alaska, and Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico,
but both were quickly resolved. The 1995 incident at Owl
Cave, Virginia, is interesting due to the technique used to free
the hapless caver.
Trapped/Stranded
This is a new category used to describe incidents in
which the caver or cavers are prevented from exiting the cave
by rockfall, light failure, lack of equipment, equipment failure,
or other causes. In most of the reported incidents,
"spelunkers" were stranded by light failure and/or poor
judgment.
Exhaustion
There were four incidents in 1994 in which cavers
became too exhausted to exit and required assistance. All were
resolved by the caving party or with some assistance from
friends, with the exception of the incident in Fern Cave,
Alabama, where a large rescue operation was mounted to
assist a caver stranded at the bottom of a 400-foot deep pit.
The 1995 incident involved the rescue of an inexperienced
caver from a pit in Kentucky.
Difficulty on Rope
There were eleven incidents in 1994 in which cavers
encountered serious difficulty on rappel or ascent. One of
these resulted in a fatality at Real Well, Tennessee. In most
other cases the problems were resolved with some assistance
from members of the caving party. One of the four incidents
in 1995 involved a caver who suffered broken ribs in a fall in
Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico, and who subsequently
became stranded on rope at Boulder Falls, requiring rescue.
Other
This catch-all category includes the pipe bomb found
in Hush-Hush Cave, Utah, along with the chopped rope at San
Augustin, a broken finger in an Arkansas cave, difficulty in
swim in Aire Fresco Cave, Mexico, washed out to sea from a
Hawaiian sea cave, washed into a sea cave in California, a
hand injury in Hurricane Cave, Colorado, and a few other
mishaps. Probable the most notable are the Safford Shafts
explosion and entrapment (the victim poured gasoline into a
Acknowledgments
I would like to thank all the people who have contributed reports for this issue. Several notable correspondents have
contributed a large portion of the material for these reports. They include Richard Breisch, Bill Torode, Chuck Porter, Butch
Feldhaus, Buddy Lane, and Scott Fee. Camille Duke helped get the mailing set up and provided much useful information, as did Tom
Rea and Fred Wefer. Mark Wolinsky, Ron Simmons, Buddy Lane, and John Lyles provided photos. Mary Foster did much of the
typing. Bob Hinchley helped prepare the statistical tables and summaries. Richard Blackburn was a great help with the proofreading. I
would also like to thank Steve Knutson for his assistance in the preparation of this issue and for his years of service to the Society as
Editor of ACA. Steve revived ACA and built it into the valuable resource that it has become. We all appreciate his efforts and
contributions.

pit and ignited it) and the caver who drove his snowmobile
into a pit while looking for caves in a snow-covered lava field.
Outside Incidents
There were two outside incidents reported in 1994
and none reported in 1995. The first 1994 incident involved
difficulty on rappel due to hair caught in a rappel rack at a
practice cliff. In the second incident, a man was killed when
he drove his car into a sinkhole that had formed in the middle
of a highway in Maryland. These are not included in the
regular accident totals, since they are only peripherally related
to caving.
Cave Diving Incidents
Of the seven diving incidents in 1994, four involved
divers trained and certified in cave diving. The Sotano de San
Augustin incident involved the use of complex rebreather
technology. It is unclear whether operator error, the diver's
diabetes, or some other factor caused the accident. The
Zacaton incident is also puzzling, with no indication of the
cause of the fatality other than a reported past experience with
blackout at depth. In both cases the divers were pushing the
limits of technology and exploration. Sheck Exley's death in
Zacaton was a shock to many in the diving community. He
was widely recognized as an expert in cave diving and deep
diving with SCUBA equipment.
Two other 1994 incidents involved trained cave
divers who apparently ignored standard safety practices
regarding air management rules and guideline use, with tragic
results. Two incidents resulting in multiple fatalities were
attributed to open water divers entering caves without proper
training or equipment. A snorkeler became lost and
disoriented in a sea cave, but was eventually able to find his
way out.
The 1995 diving incidents include another snorkeler
rescued from a sea cave, as well as five incidents resulting in
fatalities. The incident in Thunderhole, Florida, involved a
trained cave diver who apparently used the wrong mixed gas
bottle on a deep dive. The others involved open water divers
who entered caves without proper training and equipment.

Bad Air In Caves
William R. Elliott, Ph.D.
This article was revised from one which appeared in Cavers' Digest
Many have debated the sources of bad air in caves.
Caves that flood may have O2 depletion and CO2 production
from bacterial digestion of organic matter. In Texas there are
some karst areas that commonly have bad air, but little
flooding. There may be biogeological sources of CO2 in these
areas, but this hypothesis (Elliott, 1995) is unproven as yet. I
have a lot of unpublished data from bad air caves in Texas, in
which I measured CO2 with a Drager tube and O2 with an
Edmont O2 meter.
Normal atmospheric CO2 is about 0.035% (350 ppm)
and O2 is 20.9%. In my experience most cavers can easily
tolerate increased CO2 levels of 3% (with a similar decrease of
O2 to about 18%), and may only breathe a bit heavily even
after resting. At 4% most cavers will be puffing, and at 5%
most are panting hard and will give up and leave. I have
driven myself to breathe 5.5% CO2 with 12.5% O2 for a short
time, but paid for it later (a hangover the next day, soreness,
crankiness, etc.). Some people become very ill and vomit after
coming out into the open air, a lot like the "off effects" after
anesthesia. Most get violent headaches (I don't for some
reason). Loss of judgment is a real problem - in one
celebrated case in Texas, cavers tried to survey Marguerite
Cave in very bad air. They would forget to write down data,
then would say "forget it" and go on to the next station. They
almost gave up getting out of the very tight entrance, and
might have died if one guy had not gotten up the energy to
struggle out and help the others out.
Most people will pass out at an O2 level of 10%, but
some need higher levels and there is a time factor as well.
Luckily for us, the body has a CO2 detector in the circulatory
system that triggers harder breathing as dissolved CO2 rises.
This helps us to compensate for awhile, but at about 17% O2
we cannot compensate further, SO we begin to lose the battle at
that point. Time to get out!
In the USA the federal Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) does not allow workers in a
closed space with less than 19.5% O2 at any time without
breathing apparatus. There's a good reason for that - a worker
climbing down a ladder into a tank or a rusty ship's hold may
quickly go from 20.9% O2 to a very low concentration in a
short distance. So, the 19.5% limit gives a large safety margin.
A similar hazard exists in bad air pit caves, where the heavier,
CO2-rich air can stratify. It can be quite dangerous to descend
into such a pit, and cavers in bad air karst regions have had a
lot of near misses. Sometimes the only thing that held them
back was their carbide lamps going out just below the lip.
Horizontal caves don't behave that way. Workers are not
allowed to work a shift in more than 0.5% CO2, but this would
be a joke to most cavers. Many caves in Texas have > 1% CO2
in the summer, and it's not even noticeable to the average
caver.
In bad air cave areas, like San Saba and Burnet
counties, Texas, cavers often use the "Bic test" to determine
when to leave a cave. Butch Fralia (1989) determined that a
common Bic butane lighter will begin to flicker and form a
gap between the jet and flame at 18.5% O2. A one-inch gap
forms at 17.5%, and the lighter will go out but can be re-lit. At
17% the Bic will not light; at this level most cavers would be
breathing hard, but the Bic test seems to give them a good
advance warning. In Colorado Bend State Park cavers often
use an oxygen meter with a long probe to check the air before
entering very far into a pit cave; the meter is supplied by the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. Sometimes they
ventilate caves with hoses and blowers.
In the carbide days, a cap lamp going out or getting a
weird, separated flame was also a good sign that it was time to
leave. Some of the bad air pits in Texas are dangerous in the
summer, with O2 concentrations below 12% and CO2 above
6%. I have measured O2 as low as 11% in Skull Cave at San
Antonio, by sucking air out via a small hose with a small air
sampling pump attached. Skull had to be surveyed by two
cavers wearing scuba tanks. The air was SO "carbonic" that it
burned their eyes, and they could taste the air when they took
their mouthpieces out to speak (Veni and Elliott, 1994).
My studies usually found that CO2 and O2 levels
mirrored each other rather closely - as one increased the other
decreased. But at lower O2 concentrations there was a lag in
CO2 increase. The difference is made up by nitrogen. Julia
James has published some papers on "foul air" caves in which
she has noticed this same phenomenon, which may be called
"stink damp", an old British mining term. In Gorman Cave,
Texas, I took air samples on charcoal for lab analysis but
found no organic compounds in the bad air.
In bad air different individuals experience different
symptoms at different times. CO2 has anesthetic properties,
and has been used to stupefy cattle before slaughter. Most
people develop a headache, some get silly, some lose their
judgment, some become animated, others become exhausted.
In my experience, novices sometimes get panicky and may
even hyperventilate in overreaction. Paranoia and
claustrophobia sometimes set in quickly with novices, and I
think even low levels of CO2 can worsen this. Experienced
cavers, in my opinion, become somewhat oblivious to mildly
bad air and develop a "body expectation" that goes along with
the whole caving experience. This expectation would unnerve
many normal people. (Maybe it also causes minor brain
damage and that's why we continue to go caving hmmm.
Maybe it also causes minor brain damage and that's why we
continue to go caving Wait, I already said that. That's all for
now.)

Caving Risk Assessment Grid
John Gookin
I use this caving risk assessment grid in teaching caving. It helps me talk to other instructors about what sorts of caves, or
passages, are appropriate for different levels of students. It especially helps me be proactive about letting students go into a passage or
new cave without instructor supervision. I realize that my peers in the NSS use informal mentors more than formal instructors, but the
same principles apply. I would appreciate any comments or suggestions that might help make the grid more useful.

1994 Accident and Incident Reports
January
Mammoth Cave, Kentucky
rockfall
A slab of limestone 50 feet long and 20 feet wide and
about six inches thick fell from the ceiling of the Rotunda,
about 800 feet into the cave from the Historic Entrance. The
slab damaged the remnants of the historic 1812 saltpeter
mining operation, however the tours through the area were not
affected. Due to the severe weather, the park had been closed
for three days and no one was present when the rockfall
occurred. The damage was discovered when regular tours
resumed on January 20th. It is thought that the extremely cold
air entering the cave produced a frost-wedge effect which
caused the slab to fall.
1. Ian Ellis, "Rockfall in Mammoth Cave", NSS News,
v52n4, April 1994, p. 129.

Journal, 29 January 1994, reprinted in The CIG
Newsletter, v38n3, March 1994, p. 28.


********** 5 February
Caballo Cave, New Mexico
rockfall, fatality
Leland Smith (40) was killed while exploring
Caballo Cave, New Mexico, when two large boulders fell and
crushed him. Smith was a volunteer assisting in a youth group
trip led by caver Steve Peerman.
The accident occurred as the group was exiting the
cave. Peerman and several of the students had climbed over a
sloping piece of breakdown in a chimney leading to the
entrance room and were waiting for the rest of the group. As
Smith helped one of the students up to the top of the slab, a
large piece of it broke off and fell on him. Smith and the rock
fell further down the chimney, and a second section of slab
fell on top of them. Smith sustained numerous fractures
including legs, neck, and spine, and was killed instantly.
Peerman and another adult volunteer rushed to the scene and
found that Smith was dead. They were unable to move the
rocks which pinned him in the crevice. They group exited and
notified the authorities.
A body recovery operation was conducted the next
day. Shoring was used to stabilize the area around the slab,
which was found to have been held in place primarily by
flowstone cementing. A problem arose when it was
discovered that Smith had been carrying a semiautomatic
pistol concealed in a shoulder holster. He had been a police
officer and had a permit for the weapon. With assistance from
a law enforcement officer, the pistol was removed and
rendered safe and the recovery proceeded. After a substantial
amount of excavation and rock moving, the body was freed
and removed. In the process, another slab was knocked loose,
bumping a rescuer as it fell. He received only a minor bruise.
1. Steve Peerman, "Accident Report", Muddy Litter Letter,
Issue 19, May/June 1994, p. 6.
2. Duke McMullan, "Fatality in Caballo Cave", The Bexar
Facts, v94n2, February 1994, p. 10.
3. Steve Peerman, "Body Recovery Operation", Muddy Litter
Letter, Issue 20, July/October 1994, p. 3.
Comments: Peerman notes that the route over the
slab was part of the standard route in and out of the cave, and
that it had been traversed by hundreds of people over the years
with no previous problem. The cave had long been considered
safe for novices.


********** 5 February
Nutty Putty Cave, Utah
caver fall, injury
Ralph Powers, Eric Malm, and Brian Flick entered
the cave for a Utah Cave Search and Rescue practice session.
Shortly after entering, Powers' helmet-mounted light failed.
He had left his spare batteries and backup light outside, and
had to borrow a flashlight from Malm. He mounted the
borrowed light on his helmet and continued. Later, while
negotiating a chimney, he attempted to position himself in the
chimney to point out holds to Flick, who was having
difficulty. Powers lost his footing and fell, striking a ledge
with his hip. He was able to climb back up and exit the cave
with some assistance from his companions. He suffered a cut
on his elbow as well as bruises and abrasions to his hip.
Ralph Powers, "Mommy I Fall Down Again", The Utah
Caver, v6n2, April 1994, p. 24.
Comments: Powers notes that the experience taught
him not to take even easy and familiar caves lightly. Also, he
should have been carrying his own backup lights rather than
relying on his companions.


********** 6 February
Fisher Ridge Cave, Kentucky
difficulty on rope, equipment problem
Joe Saunders, Charlie Pflanze and Ken Aanderode
entered the Remington Entrance of the Fisher Ridge Cave
System in a surveying trip. After completing their work, they
exited back into Fisher Avenue via a climb off of the ceiling
of Roaring River. Joe Saunders had trouble going up rope due
to his jumars slipping on the ice-coated rope. Charlie had
splashed through the Remington Canyon and was suffering
with very cold feet.
Joe Saunders, "Kentucky Cave Log", Feb. 5-6, 1994, D.C.
Speleograph, v50n5, May 1994, p. 10.
Comments: Ascenders with spring-loaded cams will
often slip on muddy or icy ropes. Layered neoprene socks can
help prevent cold feet in wet caves.

---------- Page 13 ----------


********** 13 February
Sloans Valley Cave, Kentucky
lost
Brandon Conlon (18) and Joe Van Eaton (18), both
from Cincinnati, Ohio, were found after being lost for more
than 40 hours in Sloans Valley Cave System. They entered the
cave on the 13th with a companion, Daniel Hume (18, also
from Cincinnati). Hume left the cave early, citing "a bad
feeling about the cave." The others planned to stay in about
two hours. When his companions did not return, Hume
remained with their car and waited. He never called for help
or reported them overdue. Asked why he did not call for help,
Hume said he "didn't want to bring a bunch of people out (to
search) and then they would come out." He stated that he
spent the two days "mostly sleeping in a car" parked nearby.
Hume was overheard at a nearby store talking about
waiting for his friends in the cave and was questioned by
bystanders, who then called 911. Rescuers entered the cave
and found the young men about 400 feet inside. The lost
cavers had become totally confused, and were cold and
hungry. They were poorly equipped, with only one flashlight
between them, no helmets, and no food or extra clothing.
After consuming food brought in by the rescuers, they exited
under their own power.
1. Editor, Cave Cricket Gazette, v19nl, Spring 1994, p. 20.
2. Bill Mardis, "Teens found uninjured after cave ordeal",
Somerset Commonwealth Journal, v29n40, 15 February
1994, p. 1.
Comments: Inexperience, inadequate equipment,
poor judgment. One wonders just how long Hume would have
waited before deciding to call for help.
February
Aire Fresco Cave, Mexico
difficulty in swim, equipment problem
While negotiating a 100-meter long swim in the cave,
a caver had trouble and required assistance. A bag of
equipment she was carrying was not buoyant as expected, but
instead became filled with water, pulling her down. She called
for help and was pulled from the water. The bag was lost.
Steve Knutson, personal notes, undated.
Comments: It is fortunate that the bag was not
tethered to the caver. When crossing deep streams or pools
you should be prepared to abandon your pack or equipment if
necessary. It is better to lose the gear than to lose your life.
February
El Chorreadero, Mexico
caver fall, broken leg
A group of cavers were doing a pull-down trip in El
Chorreadero. After pulling down the rope from the first
rappel, one member of the party fell while climbing down a
pitch. The caver's foot jammed in a crack, resulting in a
broken leg. The leg was splinted with a piton hammer. Since
there was no way back up, the group continued down to the
lower entrance, traversing about two kilometers of passage
and a continuing series of small pitches. The injured caver
was not wearing gloves, and suffered hand injuries while
crawling over breakdown and moving through the cave.
Steve Knutson, personal notes, undated.
Comments: The tenacity of the injured caver is
admirable. Gloves are generally a good idea, though some
cavers refuse to use them. In this incident, self-rescue almost
certainly allowed the injured caver to exit and receive
treatment sooner than the typical "wait here and send for help"
rescue scenario would have allowed. The decision to attempt
self-rescue depends on many factors. Since the cavers were
doing a pull-down trip, the fastest way out was to continue.


********** 5 March
Hush-Hush Cave, Utah
bomb scare, difficulty on rope
David Herron, Dan Clyde, Marsha Clyde, Ralph
Powers, Rob Cranney, and another (unidentified) caver
entered Hush-Hush Cave, descending pits of 20 and 60 feet,
with a short section of steep slope over breakdown between
the pits. The second pit is permanently rigged with a ladder
made of bars and chain. They opted not to use this, and rigged
both drops with a 130-foot rope. The first cavers down found
what appeared to be a crude, homemade pipe bomb. They
examined it and decided to leave it alone and continue the trip.
On the way out, Marcia Clyde became stuck at the lip
of the 60-foot pit where the rope was rigged over a sharp
overhang. After about ten minutes and with some assistance,
she made it over. The rope was relocated to provide an easier
lip. On the way out they retrieved the suspected pipe bomb
and took it out of the cave. After some discussion, they
decided to leave it hidden under a large rock away from the
road.
David Herron, "Adventures in Pack Rat Paradise", The Utah
Caver, v6n2, April 1994, p. 26.
Comments: Suspected explosives found in caves
should be reported to law enforcement authorities. They
should not be disturbed.


********** 12 March
Sinnett-Thorn Cave, West Virginia
lost
Six teenage Boy Scouts and one adult leader became
lost while exploring Sinnett Cave when they could not locate
the connection passage to the Thorn Cave entrance. They were
located by a local rescue squad 13 hours after the group had
entered the cave.
1. Bill Klimack, "In the Media", NSS News, v53n1, January
1995, p. 22.
2. Pendelton West Virginia Times, 24 March 1994.

---------- Page 14 ----------
Comments: It appears that the Boy Scouts of
America policy on caving was not followed. There should
have been another experienced adult caver on the trip.


********** 22 March
Los Juanitos, Mexico
bad air
During the third year of exploration to the Los
Juanitos Cave System a party was to try to reach the bottom of
the entrance shaft. They knew from previous exploration that
there was bad air 400 feet below the entrance. For this reason
they carried a hazardous atmosphere analyzer. They also had
oxygen cylinders for use at depth. Due to concern about
rockfall, they rigged the pit in three pitches. They first
descended the 170-foot drop to Dangerous Ledge. A second
drop of 630 feet led to the Great Ledge. From there the group
was to descend the remaining distance to the cavern floor.
Two ropes were rigged side by side for the descent,
which was made by John Galdamez and Tim Matlick. Two
hundred feet below the lip of the Great Ledge the ropes
became tangled. Galdamez and Matlick tried undo the snarl,
but became exhausted due to inadequate oxygen. They
retreated to the Great Ledge to try to regain some strength.
However, due to the bad air and high altitude (9,000 feet) they
found recovery slow. They decided to abort the trip and return
to the surface.
Jonathan Smith and Steve Ford, "Exploration of Los
Juanitos", NSS News, v53n10, October 1995, p. 270.
Comments: Caving in a hazardous atmosphere is a
serious undertaking and should be avoided by those not
properly trained and equipped for the task. Special air packs
are used by trained fire and rescue workers, not
"supplementary oxygen cylinders" such as those carried by
the cavers on this trip. It was wise to turn back. The
equipment was inadequate to the task and the results, had they
continued, might well have been tragic.


********** 26 March
Pine Hill Cave, Kentucky
caver fall, injury
Mike Hood and Colin Gatland of the Dayton
Underground Grotto led a group of 12 Boy Scouts and their
leaders on a trip to Pine Hill Cave, Kentucky. At
approximately 1:45 p.m., while climbing up an eight to ten
foot high mud bank, one of the scouts, Joe Moore (14),
slipped and fell forward. He was climbing the mud bank on all
fours when he fell and both arms were extended backwards
resulting in the dislocation of his right shoulder. One caver
exited the cave and called for assistance. Two paramedics
responded and were taken to the accident site by the cavers.
The victim's shoulder was immobilized and he was
packaged and carried out of the cave. Moore was out of the
cave by 7:00 p.m. and was taken to a local hospital where the
dislocation was reduced.

v3n4, April 1994, p. 42.
Comments: Hood notes that the boy had dislocated
the shoulder twice before. He was not doing anything unsafe,
and was climbing slowly and carefully when he slipped on the
mud bank. Flynn notes that an adult member of the boy's
group attempted to set the shoulder before the paramedics
arrived. It is risky for an untrained person to attempt to
reduced a dislocation. Unless there are extenuating
circumstances, the best procedure in such cases is to
immobilize the dislocated limb and leave the reduction to
trained professionals.
March
Bowden Cave, West Virginia
lost
Two Boy Scouts were rescued from Bowden Cave
after becoming lost. They had become separated from the
others in their group when they went up a dead end passage.
The noise from the high water in the cave prevented the others
in the group from finding them immediately and hampered
later search efforts.
Muddy Litter Letter, Issue 18, March/April 1994.
Comments: A whistle is a useful signaling device in
such situations. Cavers should consider including one in their
packs.
March
Sotano de San Augustin, Mexico
caver fall, injury, equipment failure
This incident happened in the Lower Gorge of
Sotano de San Augustin about a week before Ian Rolland's
death. Don Coons was leading a five person team to Camp III
to carry equipment in support of the planned diving efforts.
They were rigging the route from Tommy's Borehole to the
San Augustin Sump. Coons had just rigged the Grand Cascade
- a major waterfall in the Lower Gorge. The rig consists of
five rebelays on two natural anchors and three bolts which
serve to place the rope out of the waterfall along the right
hand wall of the passage.
Coons decided to use the existing bolts and hangers
since they were situated between the natural rig points. This
hardware was 15 to 18 years old. Four of the team members
passed the rebelays without incident. Just after Coons passed
the third rebelay a bolt hanger broke, sending him crashing
into the wall near the waterfall and into the water. The impact
resulted in several cracked ribs. Coons was able to recover,
continue past the remaining rebelays, and complete the
descent. Because of the injury, the team decided to stop at
Camp III, where they spent the night. They exited the next
day. All of the team members inspected the bolts and hangers
and noted them to be a bit rusty, but did not see any obvious
cracks.
Pat Kambesis, "More Information on Death of Ian Rolland",
The Bexar Facts, v94n4, May 1994, p. 3.

---------- Page 15 ----------
Comments: Hardware left in caves for long periods
can degrade or be damaged without any evidence apparent to
visual inspection. Be suspicious of old anchors and be sure to
use adequate backups. Arrange your rigging to minimize
shock loads in the event that a component fails under load.
March
Sotano de San Augustin, Mexico
chopped rope
It was also reported that during the March expedition
to Sotano de San Augustin that there was an incident in which
a rope at the entrance pit was cut or damaged by a machete
while in use. No one was injured.
Steve Knutson, personal notes, undated.
Comments: In areas where this is a problem it is wise
to leave a person on the surface to guard the equipment and
rigging.
March
Sotano de San Augustin, Mexico
rack rigged backwards
In another near miss, a caver from Mexico City
threaded his rack backwards at the top of a 110-meter pit, but
caught himself just in time by grabbing a rebelay with his
hand.
Steve Knutson, personal notes, undated.
Comments: Check your equipment before you put
your weight on it. Use a safety ascender or cow's tail while
rigging your rappel device, and don't remove it until you have
placed your full weight on the descending rig. Checking your
fellow cavers' equipment and rigging and asking them to
check yours is an important part of good teamwork in the
cave.


********** 1 April
unnamed sinkhole, Maryland
drove car into sinkhole, fatality
In the early hours of April 1st, a 35 by 40 foot
sinkhole opened in the middle of Maryland State Route 31 in
Carroll County. This is within a karst area not very well
known to cavers which extends across central Maryland.
Robert Knight (24) of Taneytown drove his van into the hole
and was injured. He was extricated after about 2 hours in the
hole, but died later that day from head injuries sustained in the
crash. The highway department later filled the hole with an
estimated 1000 tons of rock. A geologist noted that fields in
the area show evidence of many similar sinkholes. An
estimated 4,700 vehicles travel the route daily.
George Dasher, "Rockin' Chair", The West Virginia Caver,
v12n3, June 1994, p. 11.
Comments: This incident is not really a caving
accident, but is included because it occurred in a sinkhole in a
karst area and was reported in several caving newsletters. It is
listed in the statistics as an 'outside' incident, and the fatality
was not counted as a caving-related fatality.


********** 17 April
Picnic Cave, Arkansas
rockfall, near-miss
Richard Honebrink, George Stowe-Rains, Robert
Ginsburg, Martha Clark, and Calvin Clark entered Picnic
Cave in Madison County for the purpose of checking out a
high lead above Sam's Dome. At the dome, Honebrink made
the easy, but very exposed 40-foot climb to a large room near
the top of the dome. He was then followed by Stowe-Rains.
The rest of the party was behind a large projecting
rock on the opposite side of the dome, except for Calvin
Clark. He had been warned by Martha Clark to wait to begin
his climb until Stowe-Rains was done, but instead started his
climb before Stowe-Rains reached the top. Near the top
Stowe-Rains dislodged a rock weighing over 100 pounds. It
bounced off the walls several times barely missing Calvin
Clark, who ducked into an intermediate level passage. The
rest of the party climbed without incident.
Richard Honebrink, "Near Miss in Picnic Cave", The Boston
Mountain Underground, v6n2, Summer 1994, p. 17.
Comments: Wait outside the rockfall zone until the
previous climber is clear. Use signals to indicate when
someone is beginning a climb or is clear, just as in rope work.
April
Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico
caver fall, injury
Ron Delano, Steve Micola, Donald Davis, and Dave
Jones entered Lechuguilla Cave for a multi-day survey trip.
As the cavers were making their way through the Deep Seas
complex beyond Lake Louise, Steve Micola made a small
route-finding error just above the first hand-line. He started
stemming up a chimney when a big knob foothold broke
under his weight. He fell a few feet and hit his shoulder on a
wall. Micola and Davis joined Jones and Delano at the start of
the Western Borehole, where Micola's situation was
discussed. Micola said his shoulder was bruised but not
seriously hurt and felt that he could continue with the trip as
planned.
The group returned to camp with little difficulty
although Micola later indicated he was having some trouble
moving his arm. On day seven as the cavers prepared to make
the 160-foot rope climb at Boulder Falls, they were concerned
that Micola might have trouble with his Mitchell climbing
system due to the need to raise his arms. Micola used a rope
walker system instead, and ascended slowly but without
difficulty.

Spring
Valhalla, Alabama
difficulty on rappel, glove caught in rack
A group of five cavers were descending the 227-foot
entrance shaft of Valhalla. Jane Prendergrast was the second
person to descend. After passing the lip, she stopped to
remove some bars from her rack. In the process, her glove
became caught in the rack and she was unable to free it. At the
time there were only three bars in place on the rack. She called
for a bottom belay, which was provided, and was able to
complete her descent with some difficulty, being forced to
feed the rope through for the next 150 feet. During the descent
the moving rope wore a hole through the glove.
1. Joe Levinson, Incident report, 9 September 1996.
2. Jane Prendergrast, personal communication, 1 September
1997.
Comments: Levinson comments that the appropriate
action would have been to attach a safety ascender and either
remove the obstruction, change over to ascent, or call for
assistance. He notes that this would have been a bigger
problem if her hair had been caught instead of a glove. In
addition, he notes that three bars provide very little friction,
and that she could have lost control of the rappel had the
glove come free. It is very helpful in performing a change-
over or clearing a jammed rappel device if the safety ascender
has a foot sling that can be attached.
Effectiveness of the bottom belay would have been
significantly reduced with only three bars on rope. Three bars
do not provide sufficient friction for a safe rappel. In addition,
if one more bar becomes disengaged the rappeller will go into
free fall. Many experienced cavers consider five bars the
minimum for safe, controlled descent. Lighter cavers who can
not descend on five bars should use longer racks with more
room to spread the bars.


********** 1 May
Fulford Cave, Colorado
caver fall, head injury, no helmet
A group of three Colorado Grotto cavers entered
Fulford Cave after a two mile hike in snowshoes. The cave is
located at 10,000 feet of elevation and contains many ice
formations.
At about 3:00 p.m. they encountered Bruce Stewart
(30s) and a younger man (20s), each of whom was equipped
with a single flashlight and wearing a bandanna across his
forehead. The Colorado Grotto cavers politely reminded the
men that three light sources and head protection are
considered standard equipment for safe caving. Stewart and
his friend ignored the warning and continued into the cave as
the Grotto members headed for the exit.
Stewart later slipped and fell, suffering a cut on his
forehead. He exited the cave under his own power and his
bleeding forehead was treated by grotto members at the
culvert entrance.
Michael Zawada, Accident report, 15 May 1994.
Comments: Inexperience, inadequate equipment,
poor judgment. Zawada notes that the mishap could have
easily become serious due to the freezing conditions in the
cave. A helmet and a helmet-mounted light are the
fundamental items of equipment necessary for safe caving.


********** 5 May
Norman Cave, West Virginia
caver fall, multiple injuries
Susan Hanley (65) was injured on a commercially
guided wild caving trip led by Danny Gillespie (50) when she
fell through a hole in the passage above the waterfall. The
group entered the cave at noon and was about 600 feet into the
cave when the accident occurred. Hanley believed she was
following the route indicated by the guide and traversed by the
cavers ahead of her, but inadvertently went into an opening
that dropped to the stream below. She entered the opening
feet-first and slid down a hole, falling 27 feet to the stream
below, crushing both heels, fracturing one leg, and fracturing
several vertebrae.
Gillespie was taking photographs farther down the
passage when the accident occurred. A member of the party
helped Hanley out of the water and carried her to a dry upper
chamber away from the wind and spray of the waterfall.
Gillespie left the cave to summon help. It took 40 rescuers,
hampered by hypothermia and the tightness of the bypass,
until almost midnight to extract her from the cave and get her
to a hospital.

Virginia Caver, v15n2, April 1997, p. 17.
3. Susan Hanley, personal communications, October 1996.
Comments: Hanley subsequently filed suit against the
guide, a commercial cave where the guide had been employed
and which had advertised wild caving excursions, and the
cave owner. The NSS assisted in the defense of the cave
owner, who was later dropped from the suit when it was
established that he had no knowledge of or consent to the trip
or the guide's activities. A trial resulted and the jury
determined that Hanley was 70% responsible and that
Gillespie was 30% responsible. No damages were awarded.


********** 5 May
Sotano de San Augustin, Mexico
insulin imbalance
At 1:00 a.m. Bill Steele and Noel Sloan heard low
grunts and moans coming from somewhere in Camp III of
Sotano de San Augustin. Sloan found Don Broussard (46)
thrashing about in his sleeping bag. He was suffering from
low blood sugar and was too weak to manipulate the zipper.
Sloan, an MD, directed the other cavers to prepare a
solution of sugar and water. Sloan held the bottle as Broussard
drank the solution. After about 20 minutes Broussard was able
to eat two small candy bars; soon he ate four more. Forty-five
minutes elapsed before he could function.

---------- Page 17 ----------
The next morning Broussard felt reasonably well and
was able to continue ferrying gear from the -620 depot to the
top of the last pitch in the Bowl-Hole series Broussard
decided that the adjustment of insulin and food that he had
made for his activity level was incorrect.

********** 7 May
Lone Bat Cave, Alabama
stranded, no light
Kuenn Drake (35), Bernard Powell, and David Drake
(38) entered Lone Bat Cave to continue their exploration of
the new find by descending a 40-foot pit. At the cave
entrance, David Drake discovered that he had no functioning
lights. He borrowed a light from one of his companions and
entered. The cavers rigged the pit and Kuenn Drake and
Powell descended, leaving David Drake at the top. David
Drake intended to do the pit also, but accidentally dropped his
borrowed light into the pit and was forced to wait in the dark
for help.
Kuenn Drake, "Lone Bat Cave: The Final Chapter", Cullman
Grotto Flowstone, v1n4, June, 1994, p. 3.
Comments: Check your gear before the trip, not at
the entrance. Each caver should have three working sources of
light in his possession.


********** 21 May
Crystal Ice Cave, Idaho
difficulty on rope, stranded in pit
A group of four cavers (no names given) planned to
make a through-trip from the Crystal Ice Cave entrance to the
Great Cavern entrance. One of the group was not experienced
in vertical techniques, SO they held a brief vertical training
session at his home on the day before the trip. The new caver
was using a home-made ascending system using high-
mounted Gibbs ascenders tethered to his seat and chest
harnesses. The new caver had a lot of difficulty trying to use
the system but they decided to take him on the trip anyway.
At the cave the next day, the cavers prepared for a
through-trip by rigging a rope at the 140-foot pit into Great
Cavern. They then entered Crystal Ice Cave and descended a
42-foot drop. They toured the cave and then rigged a 60-foot
pull-down rappel into Great Cavern. In order to exit they had
to climb the 140-foot pit. Two of the cavers ascended, taking
about two hours. After reaching the top they decided that the
rope needed to be repositioned. The new caver had become
very cold, stiff, and scared. He tried to climb but was unable
to get more than a few feet off the floor. The leader got him
back down, and decided to climb out and try rigging a haul
system.
The trip leader had a come-along in his truck, but
decided it would be too slow. He drove his Land Cruiser to
the lip and tied his haul rope to it. He padded the lip with
carpet and some pants and stationed some of the group at the
lip to watch for problems. Using the vehicle, the leader slowly
hauled up the new caver. The new caver reported that he was
scared stiff but that he was happy to get going after waiting on
the bottom of the drop for three hours.
Scott Earl, "Near Miss at Crystal Ice Cave", Idaho Down
Under, Summer 1994, p. 6-7.
Comments: Vehicles should never be used to haul
people up drops. They can not be controlled precisely enough
for safe use, and do not allow any feel for the tension in the
rope. Should the haul rope or the patient become snagged,
rope failure and/or severe bodily injury can easily result. Earl
notes that at one point the stranded caver's feet became caught
in a crack, but fortunately he was able to free them before they
were pulled off. A haul system is much safer. In this case a
3:1 Z-rig would probably have done the job nicely.
The new caver's climbing system was inefficient and
inadequate for a 140-foot climb. On the previous day he had
been unable to climb much more than a foot off the ground.
Since they knew this from the practice the day before, one is
left wondering why he was permitted to make the trip. The
trip was clearly not advisable for a novice vertical caver.
In addition, the four cavers were sharing two sets of
vertical gear, which is never a good idea. Each caver should
have his own rig. Earl also writes that the trip leader's first
words when describing the trip afterwards were, "I knew it
was going to happen." As Earl notes, that should have
signaled the cancellation of the trip.


********** 21 May
Paradise Lost Cave, Indiana
caver fall, injury, inadequate equipment
Phil Kreese (19) was rescued from Paradise Lost
Cave after he fell approximately ten feet while climbing a
knotted 3/4 inch manila rope hand-over-hand up a 35-foot pit.
Kreese was exploring the cave with four friends. All had
helmets, but no vertical gear and very little caving experience.
Kreese was taken to a nearby hospital where he was treated
and released. He received some stitches in his head, had a
probable concussion, and multiple lacerations.
Anmar Mirza, Incident report, 25 May 1994.
Comments: Inexperience, inadequate equipment.
Manila rope is unsafe for caving. Doing pits hand-over-hand
on knotted rope is unsafe no matter what kind of rope is used.


********** 22 May
Formation Pit, Alabama
caver fall, stranded in pit, no equipment
Chad Weismiller (14) was rescued from 76-foot deep
Formation Pit after becoming stranded on a ledge part way
down the drop. He had discovered the cave while playing with
two friends, and crawled underneath a protective steel grate to

---------- Page 18 ----------
enter the pit. He then lost his footing and fell into the pit,
where he was lucky enough to land on a small ledge. Rescuers
had to cut away the grate in order to descend and help the
stranded youth. He was pulled from the pit after about five
hours on the ledge. He suffered multiple bruises and abrasions
from his fall.

poor judgment. Weismiller had no rope, harness, helmet, or
vertical caving equipment. The gate was there for a reason.


********** 23 May
Pinnacle Cave, Nevada
caver fall, hypothermia
Elizabeth Boone, Patrick Shugrue, and James Miller
entered Pinnacle Cave southwest of Las Vegas. They had
expected to be accompanied by a more experienced caver, but
when he failed to arrive they decided to go on their own.
Miller and Shugrue had been in the cave before.
They rigged and descended a 70-foot entrance pit and
a second pit of 40 feet. Using a ball of string to mark their
path, they proceeded through various rooms and crawlways,
unrolling the string behind them. After touring for a while,
they decided to leave the cave. Miller was reeling in the string
as he walked over a large boulder when he slipped and fell off
the boulder, landed on his back on the rocks below, and
tumbled into a five foot deep hole in the rocks. The total
length of his fall was about 10 feet.
When Miller could not sit up because of the pain, the
others thought he might have a serious back injury. They left
him with food and water and exited the cave to call for help.
At approximately 8:45 p.m. rescuers were called. The initial
team entered the cave at about 11:00 p.m. and found Miller at
about 1:00 a.m. Tuesday morning. He was suffering from
hypothermia, shivering uncontrollably and slurring his speech.
Oxygen hot packs and an IV with 1000cc glucose was
administered.
At 3:00 a.m. a second team arrived with a paramedic
to further assess Miller's injuries. The rescuers decided that
the numbness and tingling in Miller's legs was due to his long
stay in a cramped position rather than to a back injury. They
helped Miller from the hole. As he began to warm up he felt
he could leave the cave with a little assistance. Rescuers
stationed themselves along the route through the cave and
assisted Miller through crawlways and belayed him up the
climbs. Miller was packaged into a litter at the bottom of the
40-foot drop and hauled up both pits. At 6:40 a.m. Miller
exited the cave and was taken to a nearby hospital where he
was found to have bruised his coccyx (tailbone).
Steve Ross, Accident report, undated.
Comments: Inexperience was clearly a factor in this
accident. Experienced cavers do not use balls of string to mark
the way. It would appear that the victim was not seriously
injured, but rather simply too scared to get up. He thought he
had spinal injuries and refused to move. As a result of his
immobility, he became hypothermic.
It was later discovered that Miller is known as "The
Fan Man" for his exploits in landing a propeller driven
parachute atop Buckingham Palace and at the Caesar's Palace
casino during a heavyweight prize fight in 1993. Outside the
hospital, Miller told a reporter that he went into the cave
because he was bored, and "it was a bad day for flying."


********** 27 May
Puckett Cave, Alabama
rockfall, injury
Kuenn Drake (35), David Drake (38), Ricky Brewer,
and Lee Gibson were exploring Puckett Cave when they came
to a large room with an unstable breakdown pile. David Drake
was the first one to find the room and had found a crawl
around the bottom of the breakdown to the other side. When
the others joined him, Drake showed them the crawl but
Kuenn Drake and Brewer decided to attempt to cross over the
breakdown pile. They made it to the other side without
incident.
David was about to enter the crawl to join them on
the other side, while Gibson considered whether he was going
further, when the "pile shifted and huge pieces of breakdown
came raining down in the passage." Part of the debris struck
Gibson on his left arm causing lacerations. David Drake,
partially in the crawl, was hit on the shin but escaped serious
injury. After finding out that Brewer and Kuenn Drake were
all right, and that the passage had not been sealed off, they
exited through the crawlway and retreated to a safer place.
The laceration on Gibson's arm was about seven
inches long and had two deep puncture wounds. Brewer had a
new pair of cloth gloves in his pack. One was used as a "wash
cloth" and one was used for a "gauze pad". It was tied in place
with shreds from Gibson's T-shirt. Gibson was able to exit
under his own power.
1. David Drake, "Near Miss in Sommerville", Cullman Grotto
Flowstone, v1n4, June 1994, p. 6.
2. David Drake, Accident report, undated.
Comments: The cavers were in virgin passage, where
loose rock is to be expected. It is possible that the passage of
two cavers over the pile was enough to destabilize it and cause
the collapse.


********** 28 May
Buffalo Creek Cave, Kentucky
equipment problem, acetylene hazard
A party of five cavers entered Buffalo Creek Cave,
Kentucky, on a survey trip. A short distance into the cave
there is a stretch of 150 feet which requires some swimming.
This was known to all before they entered the cave. One
member of the party did not package her extra carbide in a
waterproof container.

---------- Page 19 ----------
After the swim the smell of acetylene impurities was
noticed and the caver discovered that the carbide had become
wet. She wondered if it should be dumped into the stream to
dispose of it. At that moment two other cavers with carbide
lights were sitting about ten feet from this person. Fortunately,
the others realized that a pound of carbide dumped in the
water all at once might produce enough acetylene for an
explosion, and prevented this.
Although some acetylene was generated, it did not
ignite. The pack was left behind to be collected on the way
out. The cavers felt that they had enough spare carbide and
food, and the trip proceeded without further incident.
Steve McLuckie, Incident report, undated.
Comments: This incident was erroneously reported in
the previous issue of ACA as 29 May 1993. McLuckie notes
that the caver knew how to use a carbide lamp, but did not
really understand what carbide and acetylene are all about.
Calcium carbide, whether new or spent, should not be dumped
in caves.


********** 28 May
Devils Dungeon, Alabama
stranded in pit, no climbing equipment
Jonathan Wilson, Jason Burney, and Brian Smith
entered Devils Dungeon with rope and rappelling gear to do
the 147-foot pit located a few hundred feet into the cave. They
had practiced rappelling on cliffs, but had no experience in
caves. They rigged the pit with a 360-foot caving rope, and
Wilson and Burney used Petzl Stop descenders to rappel to
the bottom. They erroneously believed that the Stop could be
used as an ascender to climb the pit. They soon found that
they were stranded. Smith had remained at the top, and was
able to exit the cave and call for help. Rescuers soon arrived
and rigged a second rope. A rescuer descended the pit,
provided the boys with ascenders, conducted a brief training
session in their use, and sent them up the rope with the rescuer
climbing alongside. The rescuers then escorted the boys out of
the cave, about three hours after they had become stranded.

Comments: Inexperience, inadequate equipment,
poor judgment. The boys had not told anyone where they were
going. The cave is closed by the owner and is rarely visited.
Had the third one descended the pit, they would have been
stranded for a long, long time. The boys lived nearby and had
heard about the cave from their friends. They were thankful to
be rescued, and were encouraged to join the local grotto.

caver fall, injury
A woman caving in Laurel Caverns dislocated her

Pozo de la Escalera Cristal, Mexico
rockfall, near-miss
Don Bittle, Steve Taylor, Ray Nance, and Paul Mocal
entered the cave to map a new lead. They rappelled down the
82 and 37-foot drops without incident. Meanwhile, with the
other leads near camp dwindling down, several other people
followed them into the cave. The first group asked the
incoming cavers not to descend further because of the
possibility of rockfall.
The new passage sloped down at a 30 to 40 degree
angle. Forty five minutes passed as the passage was mapped
and photographed. Suddenly a softball-sized rock fell down
the pit. Shouting up to the top of the pit, the four on the
bottom told whoever was at the top to get back. On the way
out the first group encountered six other cavers below the first
and second drops.
Steve Taylor, Incident report, 14 July 1994.
Comments: Taylor notes that the cavers at the bottom
were not expecting anyone to be at the top of the drop and
were therefore not avoiding the rockfall zone as they would
have had more cavers been expected to descend. The rock at
the top of the pit was loose and easily broken. He suggests
that caving with a large group of people of unknown skills and
abilities was probably the primary contributing factor, and that
one would be better off avoiding such situations.


********** 15 June
Sloans Valley Cave, Kentucky
lightning
Waiting for a storm to pass before entering Sloans
Valley Cave System, Wayne Hansen, E.T. Davis and Gina
Turner were shocked when lightning struck nearby. Hansen
was on his hands and knees underneath the second (vertical)
entrance and felt a "good buzz" through his hands and a little
"trickle" in his knees. Davis also felt a tingle.
Wayne Hansen, "Sloans Valley Conservation Task Force
Field Trip Log", Cave Cricket Gazette, v19n2, Summer 1994,
p. 37.
Comments: Electrical current from a lightning strike
tends to run along the surface of the ground and will
sometimes jump across the "spark gap" created by a cave
entrance. If you happen to be standing in or near the entrance
when this happens, the current may find a better path through
your body than through the air, causing a potentially serious
shock. Avoid standing or sitting in the entrances of caves
during electrical storms. It is also risky to be on rope or cable
ladder in an entrance pit during a storm. The best course is to

---------- Page 20 ----------
wait it out well back from the entrance. If you can not retreat
back into the cave, sit on your packs and ropes for insulation
from the ground.


********** 17 June
Cueva del Brinco, Mexico
flood entrapment
During the week before the 1994 Convention, Louise
Hose, Dave Lester, Steve Lester, and Pete Squires attempted
to make a through trip from Cueva del Brinco to Cueva de
Infiernillo. Only Hose had been in the cave before, on a trip
13 years earlier. They knew that given the season there was a
risk of being trapped by water for several days between the
upper and lower sumps, but felt that the risk was acceptable.
On the way up the mountain to the Brinco entrance, Hose
noted that the springs that sometimes emerge high on the cliff
as well as the spring at the base of the cliff downstream were
flowing but the volume of water was less than that observed
on previous trips.
As they progressed through the cave they noted that
the air flow was good and the water level was not high. In the
middle part of the cave near the Titan Chamber the group had
difficulty finding the route. Hose had only been in that part of
the cave once, and was unable to find the route onward.
During the search they noticed that the air movement had
stopped. After spending many hours trying to locate the route,
the group napped for several hours and then headed out of the
cave.
When they reached the World Beyond, they were
surprised to find the waterfall at the Hall of Angels much
larger than it had been 16 hours earlier. They decided to move
quickly and headed immediately for the Brinco entrance.
Places where a drizzle of water had dropped from the ceiling
when they entered were now significant waterfalls.
When they entered the smaller passage leading from
the World Beyond there was no air flow. Hose swam on alone
and found that the water and ceiling met. Hanging a piece of
flagging tape to measure the height of the water, the group
returned to a sandy area where the old route and the bypass
route split. It was 8:00 p.m. on Friday, June 17th.
They cavers changed out of wetsuits and into dry
clothing, laid their wetsuits on the ground for padding,
inventoried their food and supplies, and prepared to wait it out
huddled together under one rescue blanket. A breeze returned
at about 3:00 a.m. on the 18th. Around 7:00 a.m. on Saturday,
June 18th, the flagging tape was checked and the water had
dropped 42cm. The group put on their wet suits and exited the
cave, finding the route out very challenging due to the high
water level. They were underground for 49 hours. Once out
the group discovered that there had been a heavy rain from
about 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. on Friday. The Infernillio
entrance was still sumped, and they felt lucky that they had
not found their way through the connection after all.
1. Louise Hose, Incident report, 19 November 1994.
2. Louise Hose, "Sistema Purificacion in Flood: Un Otra
Vez", undated.
Comments: The cavers chose to enter knowing that
there was a possibility of multi-day entrapment. It is fortunate
that no one outside became alarmed and initiated a rescue
when this came to pass. Had the group not failed to find the
connection, they would have had an even longer wait at the
lower entrance.
June
Emerald Sink Cave, Texas
histoplasmosis
Seven out of eight cavers on a trip to Emerald Sink
cave developed acute pulmonary histoplasmosis after arriving
home from the 1994 NSS convention in Brackettville, Texas.
With this usually benign illness, several were put in the
hospital, one was hospitalized twice because of a relapse, and
the most severely ill needed months of convalescence. Three
cavers who caved in Mexico on a post convention trip were
similarly afflicted. One caver became symptomatic about a
week later while on a trip deep into Lechuguilla Cave (see 5
July 1994 report).
Most of those affected lived outside the southwestern
caving area. It was frightening because, in general, doctors
were unfamiliar with their acute illness. All those who were ill
are believed to have recovered.
1. Jay Jorden, "The Dreaded Word", The OZTOTL Caver,
v12n8, 22 August 1994, p. 6.
2. Dr. Warren C. Lewis, Incident report, 29 February 1996.
Comments: It was reported that some of the afflicted
cavers had also visited caves in the Langtry area, including
Langtry Lead. Warnings and descriptions of the disease were
included in the convention guidebook and other published
materials, and caves with an obvious history of histoplasmosis
were identified before the convention.
Many cavers do not realize how serious the disease
can be. The convention guidebook stated: "It is a serious
fungal infection of the lungs, eyes, or other organs and it can
be life-threatening without proper treatment. Bat caves often
contain Histoplasma spores. Cavers who have not been
exposed to 'histo' should think twice about entering bat caves
in Texas or Mexico. Novices and cavers from the northern
U.S., Canada, and Europe are especially at risk." A
description of the disease and its symptoms was also provided,
as well as a list of caves known to harbor the organism.
There is some evidence that an acute exposure can
result in infection and serious illness even in cavers with prior
exposure, who would expect to have some degree of
immunity.
June
unknown cave in Stone County, Arkansas
injury
A caver fractured and dislocated his finger on the
way out of a cave in Stone County, Arkansas. It was reported
that the accident happened after the group had gone through
the most difficult area of the cave and that the victim was not

---------- Page 21 ----------
really doing anything wrong or unsafe. The victim was able to
exit the cave without assistance.
Ray Hardcastle, "Ray's Review", NSS News, v53n6, June
1995, p. 168.


********** 5 July
Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico
histoplasmosis, exhaustion
Andy Belski, Randy Brown, and Doug Strait (42)
entered Lechuguilla Cave for a seven day exploration and
mapping trip to the Far East. The trip to the Grand
Guadeloupe Camp involves a descent to -1,200 feet followed
by an ascent to about -800 feet. The party reached camp in
about nine hours without incident.
On July 5, the third day of the trip, Strait began to
feel ill. Initial symptoms were headache and lack of stamina.
He discussed his condition with Brown and Belski, and the
three cavers decided to confine their surveying to leads near
the camp until he felt better. Strait's condition grew worse
over the next three days. He slept poorly and suffered from
fever and chills. Strait awoke on July 9 feeling quite weak, but
willing to attempt to exit the cave as planned. He had already
packed, and knew the route, SO he started out ahead of Belski
and Brown to make best use of his time. Belski and Brown
caught up with him near the low point of the route at -1,200
feet and they traveled together for the remainder of the trip
out.
Strait's progress slowed considerably as the party
ascended. Belski and Brown carried his pack the final 700
horizontal feet to the entrance shaft and up to the surface.
About 10.5 hours after leaving camp and after 156 hours in
the cave the group reached the surface. Afterward, Strait
remarked, "I once had to crawl for five miles on alpine karst
with a broken ankle, and this was far worse."
The following morning, Strait felt too ill to begin his
drive home. He spent another night in the bunkhouse, during
which he had a fever of 104.1 degrees despite having taken
aspirin throughout the day. When his condition had not
improved by the next morning, he went to a physician in
Carlsbad, where a diagnosis of lobar pneumonia was made.
He was admitted to a local hospital and a treatment regimen of
broad spectrum antibiotics was initiated. Within 48 hours his
fever abated, and he was discharged on the fifth day. He
remained in Carlsbad under medical supervision for an
additional 5 days before being cleared to return home.
Several weeks prior to the Lechuguilla trip, Strait had
gone on a trip to Emerald Sink Cave, Texas, during the
Brackettville NSS Convention. After returning home, Strait
was contacted by Dave Locklear, who had led the convention
trips to Emerald Sink, and informed that a number of cavers
who had visited the cave had developed histoplasmosis
afterward. Four weeks after becoming ill in Lechuguilla, Strait
remained ill with symptoms that appeared consistent with
histoplasmosis. He visited his personal physician, who
confirmed the diagnosis of lobar pneumonia based upon X-
rays taken in Carlsbad. The physician concurred with Strait's
hypothesis that he was suffering from histoplasmosis, which
had facilitated his contracting pneumonia. Treatment for
histoplasmosis was initiated, and full recovery was attained in
three weeks.
Doug Strait, Incident report, undated.
Comments: Strait notes that the convention
guidebook contained a warning about histoplasmosis in Texas
caves. Some may wonder why he did not decide to exit
sooner. He notes that at no time was he too ill to continue
mapping, and that the group had a comfortable and well-
stocked camp. Strait did not realize that he had histoplasmosis,
and believed that his condition would improve prior to the
scheduled exit.


********** 6 July
Beaver Falls Cave, Alaska
rockfall, near-miss, rope damage
Peter Branson, Paul Hadfield and Darcie Ziel entered
Snow White Passage in Beaver Falls Cave to continue
surveying. They descended a 40-foot pit and found that it
ended into two sumps. Paul noticed that the passage continued
via a lead 20 feet down the pitch, and swung over to it. Ziel
then began ascending the rope. When she attempted to swing
over to Hadfield, her rope caught on a small nubbin three to
four feet above her. A five foot by four foot boulder and
associated debris pulled loose and fell. Ziel had just enough
time to turn her shoulder towards the rock as it tilted past and
shoved her aside. Branson was around the corner, but the
boulder exploded very close to him.
At the bottom, the rope had been cut except for a few
fibers. About ten feet up it appeared as if a flying rock
fragment had cut through the sheathing and part way into the
core. Ziel had by this time swung into the side lead and had
released the rope for Branson to climb. He had trouble
climbing up to clip his ascender above the cut, but joined the
others with further incident.
Kevin Allred, "1994 and 1995 Tongass Cave Project
Expeditions Accident Report", undated.
Comments: Use care when making traverses or
pendulums while on rope. This incident demonstrates how
easily a flying rock fragment can cut or damage a free-
hanging rope.


********** 9 July
Junkyard Cave, Tennessee
caver fall, injury
Howard Wayt (24), a counselor with a group of high-
school students from Vanderbilt University summer
engineering program, suffered broken ribs when he slipped on
rocks and fell about five feet. He fell hard, landing on his
back, and felt he was hurt too badly to make it out on his own.
Traci Horn (10), whose father was leading the trip for the
group, led the students out of the cave and to a nearby
highway where they called for help. Wayt was carried out of
the cave about four hours after the accident was reported.
Tini Tran, "Injured explorer rescued", Nashville Tennessean,
10 July 1994, p. B1.

---------- Page 22 ----------
Comments: Anyone can slip and fall in a cave, but
this appears to be another case of inexperience, probably
compounded by poor footwear.


********** 13 July
Snowhole, Alaska
stuck while on rope
Aaron Gissburg, David Ek, and Kevin Allred were
surveying in the far reaches of Snowhole about 600 vertical
feet from the entrance. They had negotiated several squeezes,
rope pitches, and very tight, muddy fissures during the trip in.
The worst one was called "The Stripper". It is a chest
compressing fissure at the top of a drop which bells out
below. On the way out, Allred sent Gissburg ahead to save
time while waiting for the next person to climb. As Ek
reached the "The Stripper" he became stuck. His pack was on
a tether below him and kept getting hung up in the fissure.
After 45 minutes Allred yelled up to see what was wrong. Ek
replied that he was stuck and Allred suggested that he drop his
pack, which he did. Eventually Allred and Ek reached the
surface safely.
Kevin Allred, "1994 and 1995 Tongass Cave Project
Expeditions Accident Report", undated.
Comments: Allred writes that, while tethered packs
do have their advantages at times, the technique did not work
in this case. He notes that it is easier at this particular spot to
hand the packs through to someone above the squeeze.


********** 16 July
Great Expectations Cave, Tennessee
rockfall, injury
Mike Rogers and Jack Thomison visited Great
Expectations Cave to survey and continue exploration. After
finding about 1,000 feet of new walking passage and 600 to
800 feet of smaller passage, they were checking out "a
miserable lead" when a large boulder fell on Rogers, nearly
crushing him. He escaped with bruises and scrapes on his hip,
side, and knee.
Jack Thomison, "Great Expectations", TAG-Net #162, 20
July 1994.
Comments: Loose rock is often encountered in newly
discovered caves and passages. Use caution.


********** 21 July
Blowing In The Wind Cave, Alaska
rockfall
Aaron Gissburg was hit by a rock while surveying in
a remote area of Blowing in the Wind Cave near Elbow
passage. He had descended a pit with no problems, and
determined it to be blind. He then proceeded to rig for
ascending. When he took his first step and loaded the rope, a
flake the size of an open phone book was pulled loose from
the lip and fell approximately 40 feet striking him first on the
head and then on the shoulder. The rock weighed
approximately 12 to 15 pounds and hit Gissburg "exactly flat
and square" on his helmet. His head was upright and his
helmet was not damaged. Gissburg suffered only a sore neck
from the impact
Kevin Allred, "1994 and 1995 Tongass Cave Project
Expeditions Accident Report", undated.
Comments: Gissburg suggests cleaning the lip of a
new pit thoroughly to remove loose rock. It is fortunate that
the flake landed squarely on his helmet rather than striking his
shoulder edge-on. The incident demonstrates the value of a
good quality caving helmet. A 12 pound rock falling 40 feet
and striking an unprotected head would probably be fatal.
July
Desoto Falls, Alabama
stranded on rope, hair in rack
While rappelling at this practice cliff, Steve Snider
got his hair caught in his rappel rack. Steve's father was six
feet below him on another rope, and neither of the two was
carrying ascending gear. Fortunately a group of cavers and
firefighters were practicing vertical rescue near by preparing
for NCRC.
One of the participants, Doug Carson, descended a
new rope rigged beside Snider and changed over to a frog
ascending rig, tethered into Snider's harness, and lifted him to
relieve the tension on the rack and allow him to free himself.
An ascender was also attached to Snider on his own rope. He
was pulled up using a straight haul with a Gibbs capture cam.
Doug Carson, Incident report, undated.
Comments: While this incident did not take place in a
cave, it involved caving equipment and techniques at a
location used for caver training. This type of incident has
happened many times to cavers while descending pits. It
illustrates the importance of having a safety ascender or
vertical rig on while rappelling. All vertical cavers should
practice changing from rappel to ascent on rope SO that they
will know how to free themselves from this predicament.


********** 5 August
Keauhou sea cave, Hawaii
washed out to sea while exploring sea cave
Timothy Anderson (18) of Vacaville, California and
Winton Nicholson (25) of Kihei, Maui were injured while
exploring a cave on the shoreline of Keauhou. While they
were in the cave the surf washed them off of the rocks and
into the ocean. They were able to swim to the shoreline where
they were stranded at the foot of a cliff. The police responded
to a call and the two men were picked up and transported to
the Kona Community Hospital. Anderson was reported to be
in stable condition with head injuries. Nicholson was treated
for minor cuts and abrasions and released.
Newspaper clipping from an unidentified Hawaii newspaper,
8 August 1994, p. 10.

---------- Page 23 ----------
Comments: These incidents involving people being
washed into and out of sea caves demonstrate the danger
posed by waves and currents. Sea caves are more dangerous
than they might appear. People have been drowned under
similar circumstances in previous years.


********** 6 August
J-4 Cave, Pennsylvania
caver fall, injury
A group of 11 people, mostly Boy Scouts from
Delaware, entered J-4 Cave on a trip lead by experienced
caver Kirk Holzapfel. The group entered the Dome Room
sometime before noon. At about 4:00 p.m. the group was
exiting the cave. On the way out they stopped at a large
column known as Goliath. While traversing along an exposed
ledge, Nick Terranova (13) lost his grip and fell through a
hole in the floor to the right of Goliath. He fell about 40 feet,
striking the walls on the way down, and landed in an area
about 300 feet from the entrance. When his father and the trip
leader climbed down to him, Terranova had lost his helmet
and there was a pool of blood under his head from cuts on the
left side of his head. He was complaining of difficulty in
breathing and he lapsed in and out of consciousness. The
commotion alerted another group of Scouts already in the
cave and they made their way to the accident scene.
Some of the cavers exited and called the local fire
department for help at 4:22 p.m. Members of the fire
department and the Nittany Grotto entered the cave at about
4:50 p.m. and reached the victim in about five minutes. After
Terranova's injuries were examined he was packaged into a
SKED for the carry out.
Terranova arrived at the entrance at about 8:00 p.m.
He was placed into a Stokes litter and lowered down the
entrance cliff. He reached the bottom at about 8:30 p.m. and
was taken to the incident command center where an
ambulance was waiting to take him to the hospital.

Comments: Inexperience, and possibly inadequate

have been several similar accidents at this location in the cave.
A safer alternate route is available which avoids the exposed
ledge.


********** 6 August
Three Fingers Cave, New Mexico
rockfall, broken ankle
Sondra Denney was exploring Three Fingers Cave
with five companions. The group had stopped to rest and
regroup. While a member of the party was looking around
above the others he dislodged a watermelon-sized rock. It fell
and struck Denny on the lower leg, breaking her ankle. After a
lot of discussion Denny decided to try to make it out under her
own power with the assistance of the others in the group. One
of the group was sent out to tell the others in their camp that
there was a problem.
Denny basically crawled through the cave. She was
able to climb up and out of crevices and pitches, sometimes
with the aide of a belay line. Occasionally members from the
group on the surface would come in with food and Gatorade.
Denny made it the to entrance drop where an EMT had come
into the cave to help. There was a lot of discussion about
letting her climb out under her own power. It was decided that
because of the nature of the entrance and the lack of good
anchors for hauling that it might be better for her to try it.
Denny rigged in with her Frog system with a Z-rig
haul line attached to her seat harness for assistance. A member
of the group climbed alongside to provide tension on the rope
for her as she climbed and to help her past ledges. She made it
out the entrance at 6:00 a.m. She then spent five to six hours
crawling up the trail (she did not want to be carried up the
steep, exposed sections) to a level area where a helicopter
landed to pick her up.

Perspective", Speleospace, September 1994, p. 6.

Bexar Facts, v94n8, October 1994, p. 9.
Comments: Use extreme caution when climbing or
moving above others in a cave. Rockfall is always a threat in
such situations. It is best to avoid climbing above others and
to remain safely out of the rockfall zone below a climber.


********** 9 August
Endless Cave, Indiana
stranded, inadequate equipment
Joshua Garner (19) and Chris Keiner entered Endless
Cave in Washington County, Indiana. After negotiating a
stream crawl and a steep 15-foot slope which they rigged with
a hand line, they visited the Formation Room, roughly 3,600
feet into the cave. At 2:30 p.m. the two decided to exit the
cave. They tried several times to climb the hand line, but were
unsuccessful. Keiner tried once more and made it to the top.
He exited the cave and went for help. He called the police at
3:50 p.m. and they notified the Campbellsburg Volunteer Fire
Department.
Rescuers found Garner at the bottom of the 15-foot
drop at about 5:30 p.m. They lowered a rope and harness and
pulled Garner up the climb. Garner was then able to exit the
cave under his own power at 7:30 p.m. Rescuers determined
that he was just wet and cold.

********** 13 August
Barrack-Zourie Cave, New York
exhaustion
Gloria McKusick entered Barrack Zourie Cave with
Kevin Harris, Lynne Jesaitis, Marc Scott, and Tony Hopkins.
After surveying, the group headed out the Berkshire Entrance.
Although McKusick had shown signs of tiring near Le Grande
Chambre, she perked up near the swims. Unfortunately she
began to fade at the climbs. Not only was it her first wet suit
caving trip, but she was wearing a 1/4 inch wet suit. The
resistance of the stiff material depleted McKusick's energy,
leaving her unable to ascend the cable ladder climb. Harris
and Hopkins got a rope and hauled her up the last two drops.
Tony Hopkins, "Barrack Zourie: The Continuing Saga",
Northeastern Caver, December 1994, p. 107.
Comments: Thicker material makes a wetsuit harder
to cave in, but it is preferred by many cavers in cold climates.
In this case, McKusick's unfamiliarity with wetsuit caving
was a probably a factor.


********** 13 August
Doghill-Donnehue Cave, Indiana
caver fall, injury
Mike Hood, Dave Rice, Sandy Rice, Stephanie
Caldwell (26), Scott Sweet, Jason Stallard, John Wisher, and a
caver named Doug (last name unknown) entered Doghill-
Donnehue Cave near Bedford. They entered the cave around
12:30 p.m. and made an uneventful trip through the cave.
On the way in, the group had slogged through about
100 feet of knee deep mud in a section of one passage. When
exiting the cave, Hood and Dave Rice took the lower passage
back through the mud. Sandy Rice was next and chimneyed
above the passage to avoid the mud. She experienced some
difficulty near the end of the traverse, where a ledge ends and
the caver must climb up to the next level of ledges in order to
continue.
Caldwell was next to do the chimney and had
reached the same spot that Sandy Rice had trouble with. She
also had difficulty climbing up to the next level. Caldwell was
unable to back up due to the presence of two cavers behind
her.
After trying several times, Caldwell lost her footing
and fell about 15 feet to the mud-floored passage, injuring her
ankle. She was able to exit the with cave without much
difficulty but did experience some discomfort. Upon
subsequent examination she was found to have a sprained
ankle.
Mike Hood, Accident report, 18 August 1997.
Comments: Hood notes that the accident could have
been prevented by simply walking through the mud. The
cavers wanted to stay dry. The deep mud probably prevented
more severe injury.


********** 17 August
Oregon Caves National Monument, Oregon
caver fall, injury
Park employee Erica Kaplan was participating in an
after hours caving trip when her group entered the breakdown
passage about 20 feet from the Bird of Paradise phone
platform. As Kaplan was walking through the passage her foot
slipped on an uneven rock surface and she fell, first landing
on her tailbone and then falling backwards, hitting her head.
Her helmet had fallen off during the tumble. She was
evacuated from the cave and transported to the Hospital in
Medford. She was wearing proper footwear, the standard
guide helmet, and carrying a flashlight.
National Park Service Incident Report, 2 September 1994.
Comments: According to the NPS accident report,
the "standard guide hard-hat" was not considered a proper
caving helmet and "no hand-held objects should be carried
when going off the established tour route." A better caving
helmet with an inelastic quick-release chin-strap would remain
on the head. A helmet-mounted light would leave the hands
free to arrest a fall. Kaplan reported that she was already tired
before they went into the cave.


********** 20 August
Stolen Well, Alabama
lost, stranded
Pat Smith and B. Stickney entered Stolen Well as
part of a party of six including Tom Moss, Angela Morgan,
John Parker, and Dan Legnini. The group entered the upper
entrance and descended the six drops (21, 55, 75, 53, 131 and
45 feet) to the bottom of the cave. After negotiating 100 feet
of passage and two difficult climb-downs of 15 feet and nine
feet the group was ready to exit the cave.
Smith and Stickney decided to exit through the lower
entrance, which is reached by about 1,300 feet of low
crawlway. That entrance was known to be closed by its owner.
They planned to meet the others back at the upper entrance if
they could find it. If not, they would rendezvous at the parking
place or at a nearby church.
The other four cavers exited via the upper entrance
by 6:30 p.m., removing all ropes from the cave as they went.
Smith and Stickney were not waiting at the upper entrance as
expected. When the group returned to the vehicles there was
still no sign of the missing pair. They checked the church, but
the two cavers were not there. The group had decided that
9:00 p.m. would be the time to became concerned if Smith and
Stickney did not show up.
The four cavers drove between the parking area and
the church looking for the two missing cavers. During this
time a strong thunderstorm moved through the area, causing
concern over possible flooding of the lower entrance passage.
Morgan used a cell phone to call other cavers to obtain more
information about the cave.
At 2:00 a.m. the lower entrance was located by
Parker and Moss. Parker went in about 200 feet and found no

---------- Page 25 ----------
evidence of anyone going through the passage. The cavers
decided to call for help.
At 4:00 a.m. the first of the rescuers arrived. Parker
and Moss once more went in the lower entrance while Morgan
waited for others to arrive to take them to the upper entrance.
Parker and Moss followed the lower entrance route to the
passage below the last climb-down where Parker had been the
day before. Parker was caving solo at this point, as Moss had
stopped earlier in the crawl due to cold and exhaustion. Parker
did not go up the two climbs. There was no sign of Smith and
Stickney.
Parker and Moss exited the lower entrance at about
10:30 a.m. Shortly afterward a team re-rigging and descending
from the upper entrance located the missing cavers in a room
below the last pit and above the two climbs. Smith and
Stickney had been unable to find the connection for the lower
entrance. They had ascended the two climbs and returned to
the bottom of the 45-foot pit, but the rest of the group was out
of ear-shot. They left an arrow and a sign reading "Buffoons"
pointing to a nearby dry chamber where they waited for
rescue.
They were wet and cold, but uninjured. Once found,
they exited under their own power and left quickly to avoid
the media. Approximately 45 rescuers were involved.

Comments: Members of the party felt that Smith and
Stickney were such strong and experienced cavers that they
must have been trapped or met with an accident. Some
reported that it did not occur to them that the pair simply
might not be able to find the route through. After waiting most
of the night, they felt that they could not take chances with
their friends' lives and decided to call for rescue.
The initial search team sent in through the lower
entrance consisted of two tired cavers from the original group
who had been up all night. They were unable to push on far
enough to reach the waiting cavers and lead them out the
lower entrance. The other two cavers from the original party
led a team in through the upper entrance which ultimately
found the missing pair. The initial response team sent into the
lower entrance should have included some fresh cavers
properly dressed for the long, wet crawl. Caving solo, Parker
was stopped just a few hundred feet from the waiting cavers.
As a result, they exited via the upper entrance somewhat later.
Smith and Stickney had overlooked the opening of
the exit passage and followed the water to a sump. Thinking
the passage had silted in, they retreated without really
searching for an alternative. A map of the cave had been
published, but no one on the trip had a copy or was aware of
its existence. The cavers had not originally planned to go out
the lower entrance, which was closed, but decided to do SO
after reaching the bottom. This incident was easily preventable
and should not have happened.


********** 27 August
Bakers Hole, Idaho
stranded on rope, equipment problems
Mike and Debbie Allen, Jim Hathorn, David Kesner,
Dave Russell, and Charlie Wilkerson planned to descend the
225-foot entrance drop to Bakers Hole. They rigged the pit
with two ropes side by side. The main rope was marked at 75
feet, 150 feet, and 250 feet with small pieces of duct tape.
Wilkerson descended first using a five bar rack.
Russell went next using a six bar rack. Wilkerson and Russell
both used a prusik knot rigged below the rappel rack as a
safety. Both were stopped during descent when the prusiks
jammed on the duct tape. They also experienced some
difficulty with the two ropes, which tended to become tangled.
Mike Allen had a six bar rack and did not use the prusik
safety. He had no problems during his descent.
Kesner descended using a five bar rack with a prusik
safety below, and was stopped by the piece of duct tape at the
75-foot mark. After some struggling he was able to release the
knot and resume his decent. At the 150-foot mark he was
stopped again. This time the prusik was jammed SO badly that
he could not loosen it. He tied a long prusik to the rope above
the rack to take his weight off of the jammed prusik.
However, with the weight of his pack (a full backpack)
pulling him backward he was unable to hold himself up long
enough to loosen the safety prusik.
Kesner decided to change over to his ascending
system. After attaching a Jumar to his seat harness and putting
on his foot Gibbs he was able to push up his safety Jumar and
sit down. Unfortunately, Kesner was using a homemade chest
harness which was improperly tied. When loaded by the
Jumar sling and the climbing rope, it tightened around his
chest like a noose. The pack continued to pull him backwards,
and the slack in the harness prevented it from holding him
upright. Eventually he became exhausted and unable to move.
He was also having trouble breathing due to constriction from
the chest harness.
Kesner called to the surface for help. Unable to
understand, Hathorn called the bottom crew using a radio.
Russell started to climb the second rope to assist. Kesner
continued to try to climb to the surface. Each time he tried to
stand the chest roller would not feed and the harness
continued to tighten. Eventually, Kesner collapsed on rope,
unable to hold himself up or breathe normally.
When Russell reached Kesner, he suggested cutting
the harness loose with a knife. Kesner would not allow this, SO
Russell got behind him and pushed him up, relieving the
pressure on his chest. Russell tried to loosen the chest harness
but could not. He removed Kesner's pack and dropped it to
the floor. He yelled "Pack!" but the cavers on bottom could
not understand and as a result "were mortified when it hit after
dropping over 100 feet."

---------- Page 26 ----------
Russell convinced Kesner to open his chest box and
release both the rope and Jumar sling while he held Kesner in
place. Once this was done Russell was able to loosen the chest
harness. Kesner was then able to climb out of the cave with
Russell climbing beside him. The whole incident lasted almost
an hour.

Comments: The cavers are to be commended for
performing a self-rescue. There are, however, several lessons
to be learned from this incident. Ropes should not be marked
with duct tape or other methods that can cause an obstruction.
The initial problem was the tape, which should not have been
there, and which caused the safety to jam when it would not
have otherwise done SO. This precipitated the change-over and
the problems that followed.
Kesner normally climbed on a Frog system, but was
using a ropewalker rig on this trip. Kesner had practiced with
the system, but had not used it in a cave before. He replaced
the borrowed chest harness with one of his own design that he
believed would be more comfortable. The chest roller was
mounted on a home-made, improperly constructed chest
harness which worked like a noose, tightening around his
chest when loaded. Using an unfamiliar system and an
untested chest harness in a deep pit was not a good idea, and
was the primary cause of the second part of the incident -
stranded and strangling on ascent.
Kesner was wise not to allow Russell to cut him
loose while on rope. Knives and loaded ropes make a lethal
combination. Loaded caving rope cuts like hot butter. There is
a high risk of accidentally cutting the wrong rope or sling, and
the consequences are severe. There is almost never a need to
cut someone free while on rope. In this case Kesner needed
only to open the chest roller and remove the rope and the
Jumar sling to relieve the tension on the chest harness. Kesner
had a safety ascender attached to his seat harness to allow him
to sit down and rest without becoming inverted.
The dropped pack presents another lesson. Whenever
anything falls down a pit, the best thing to yell is "Rock!" Not
"Camera!" or "Water Bottle!" or "Pack!" or whatever. The
universal signal for objects falling down a pit is "Rock!"
People on bottom are much more likely to understand that and
take cover instead of staring up the pit while they try to figure
out what you are yelling. In this case, the cavers on bottom did
not understand the warning and were nearly hit by the pack,
which was quite large and could have caused serious injury.


********** 27 August
Fern Cave, Alabama
stranded in pit, exhaustion, hypothermia
Lonnie Epperson (43), Mark Epperson, Ruth
Epperson, Lane Purser, and Lynn Purser entered Fern Cave
intending to descend 437-foot deep Surprise Pit. They had
made arrangements for a local caver who knows the cave well
to accompany them, but he became ill and was unable to make
the trip. They decided to go ahead on their own, and
proceeded to the cave using his directions. They entered and
rigged the drop at the customary dry rig point away from the
waterfall. Using that rig point gives a drop of 404 feet.
Lane Purser descended without incident. Epperson
began his descent at about 2:20 p.m. He used a prusik knot
above his rappel rack as a safety. During his rappel the prusik
jammed repeatedly, stopping his descent. Each time he had to
struggle to work the knot free. To release the knot, Epperson
apparently pulled himself up the rope hand-over-hand, held on
with one hand, and loosened the knot with the other. It took
about one hour for him to complete the rappel.
When Epperson reached the floor, he rappelled
straight into a supine position and asked Purser to remove his
equipment. The prusik sling was SO interwoven into the rappel
rack that Purser had to cut it free. The struggle left Epperson
completely exhausted and suffering from arm and leg cramps.
He felt he could not make the 400-foot climb out. Purser
communicated this to the cavers above using a radio. They
decided to let Epperson rest for 20 minutes to see if he might
be able to ascend. After the rest, Epperson still felt that he
could not climb out. The others decided they had no choice
but to call for help.
Rescuers arrived at the pit at about 10 p.m. Epperson
and Purser were suffering from mild hypothermia, and
Epperson still felt unable to climb the pit. He was treated for
hypothermia with heat packs and a warm air inhalation system
while the pit was rigged for hauling. Rescuers were hampered
by the small space at the top of the pit, which permitted only
six cavers to haul and required them to sit and pull rather than
walk. Crews quickly became tired and had to be rotated.
Epperson was hauled up by his seat harness with a
rescuer climbing beside him. The haul was completed in about
20 minutes. Purser climbed out in about 20 minutes on his
own. Revived by the warm air machine and some food and
drink, Epperson exited the cave and walked down the
mountain under his own power.

Comments: A Prusik knot often does not work well
as a rappel safety. Other devices such as the Petzl Shunt or a
Gibbs ascender rigged in the "Spelean Shunt" configuration
may be better. Placing the safety above the rappel device

---------- Page 27 ----------
makes it more difficult to release when engaged and increases
its tendency to jam. The sling can also become tangled in the
rappel device. Placing the safety device below the rappel
device allows better control, but requires careful arrangement
of the rappel device and the safety.
Most American cavers do not use rappel safety
devices, preferring to rely on the bottom belay. While the
effectiveness of the bottom belay may be reduced by the rope
stretch inherent in drops over 300 feet, it is still an important
safety technique. It will almost always slow if not stop an out-
of-control rappel, unless the rappeller has too few bars
engaged on the rappel rack. For maximum effectiveness,
especially in a deep pit, the belayer must be directly below the
rappeller SO that the amount of slack and stretch in the rope is
minimized. This often places the belayer in the rockfall zone.
Belaying is serious business.
It is standard practice to have a safety ascender on
the harness which can be easily attached and used to relieve
tension on the rappel device or the rappel safety. It is helpful
to have a foot sling to stand in during the procedure.
It is worth noting that it was several hours after
Epperson became stranded before rescuers reached him. It
takes a long time to mount a rescue and get people to the
patient. Some of the rescuers wondered why the group did not
simply provide Epperson with food and a sleeping bag or
warm clothing and let him rest for a few hours before
climbing out. The decision to call a rescue sets in motion a
large operation involving many people. When no injury and
no immediate threat are involved, it is usually appropriate to
consider self-rescue.


********** 4 September
Cass Cave, West Virginia
difficulty on rope
Three Ohio cavers were planning to do the 185-foot
drop in Cass Cave. They only had a 165-foot length of rope
and decided not to do the drop. A group of cavers from the
nearby Old Timer's Reunion arrived, however, and offered to
share their rope. Both groups descended and proceeded to
explore the cave. More groups of cavers continued to arrive,
SO the Ohio group decided to exit the cave. They had to wait
for about an hour due to other groups descending.
A group from Pennsylvania had arrived at the cave,
but only one decided to do the pit. As the Ohio cavers
prepared to climb, the Pennsylvania caver returned to the
bottom of the rope and wanted to be the first to climb. One of
the group from Ohio held the rope SO that the Pennsylvania
caver could get started. His gear appeared new and he had a
lot of difficulty rigging. He began climbing, ascending with
much difficulty. His foot cam did not appear to be working
correctly.
When he reached the rope pad, about 35 feet from
the top, a problem developed. The caver yelled down to the
cavers below, but they could not understand and became
concerned. After about twenty minutes of struggling, there
was a call of "Off Rope." Twenty-three people stood on the
bottom of the pit thinking something was wrong with the rope.
The next caver to climb found the rope under the pad
and against the rock. He placed the rope back on top of the
pad and climbed out. The rope appeared to be undamaged.
Once out he found some red webbing hanging into the pit.
Apparently the people at the top had untied part of the anchor
rigging and used it to help rescue the stuck caver. The
Pennsylvania group was gone. The rest of the group on the
bottom began their ascents at 6:00 p.m. It was 2:00 a.m.
before everyone was out.
Mike Liston, Incident report, undated.
Comments: The new gear and difficulty rigging were
red flags, suggesting that the climber was not familiar with his
rig. When dealing with cavers of unknown abilities, do not
hesitate to ask about their experience. It is always best to let
an experienced climber go first.
The best way to prevent this kind of incident is to go
elsewhere when the cave is crowded. It is also a good idea to
carry along some webbing or a short rope to assist a climber
who becomes stuck at the lip.


********** 4 September
Raccoon Mountain Caverns, Tennessee
caver fall, injury
While on a "wild cave" tour in the commercial cave,
a woman (30) slipped and took a tumbling fall of about 12
feet. The accident happened about 100 feet from the tourist
trail. The fallen caver complained of severe upper and lower
back pain. Rescuers were called, and the woman was
packaged and carried out of the cave. She was taken to the
hospital where she was found to have no serious injuries. She
was treated and released.

Comments: Inexperience may have been a factor.
Proper footwear (boots with lug soles) can help prevent slips.


********** 10 September
Bowden Cave, West Virginia
caver fall, injury
lain Lake (19) fell and was injured while attempting
the Hairy Traverse, located just inside the Groundhog
Entrance to Bowden Cave. The fall was about 20 feet, and
Lake was not wearing a helmet. The Groundhog Entrance is
tight. Initial attempts to bring Lake out on a stretcher and then
a backboard were not successful. In the end it was necessary
to enlarge the entrance. The rescue took about seven hours.
Lake was taken to the hospital, where he was found to have a
ruptured disk.
George Dasher, "Cave Rescues!", The West Virginia Caver,
v12n6, December 1994, p. 4.
Comments: Inexperience, inadequate equipment.
Caving without a helmet is considered very poor technique.
Lake was fortunate not to receive a head injury from his fall.
A belay should be considered for climbs over 12 feet in

be serious.


********** 11 September
New Trout Cave, West Virginia
lost, stranded, light failure
Five novice cavers became lost in New Trout Cave in
Pendleton County. The group ranged in age from 15 to 22 and
had learned of the cave from a newspaper article. They carried
only a few hand-held flashlights. Entering the cave on
Saturday, they became stranded when their lights failed.
Fortunately, an experienced caver saw the group
enter the cave and called the police later to make sure they
later exited. The police checked the vehicle registrations and
called the cavers' families to determine that they were
overdue. They were found and rescued the next day.

Comments: About 60 rescuers were called in to
search the three caves on the NSS-owned preserve. The
youths had not indicated on the sign-in sheet which cave they
intended to explore. They were fortunate that the experienced
caver decided to have someone check on them.


********** 18 September
Sloans Valley Cave, Kentucky
lost, hypothermia
Twenty people, including trip leader Chris Kerr,
entered Sloans Valley Cave to do a through-trip between two
of the entrances. Seven were experienced cavers and the rest
were novices. About four hours into the trip the group became
disoriented in the Grand Central Spaghetti region and was
unable to find the exit. They were only a few hundred feet
from three different entrances, but could not find one. Some of
the inexperienced cavers began to become hypothermic and
anxious. The group spent over four hours looking for the exit,
which they finally discovered by following a bat.
Jennifer Murray, "Field Trip Reports: Sloans Valley Cave",
Loyalhanna Troglodyte, v8n1, Fall 1994, p. 28.
Comments: Bats, air flow, and water flow are often
useful as directional indicators in caves. It would have been
helpful to have a person in the group who was more familiar
with that region of the cave.


********** 24 September
Sloans Valley Cave, Kentucky
caver fall, injury, rope failure
Gregg Harrington (25) entered the Post Office
entrance of Sloans Valley Cave in a group of 11 cavers. The
group entered at 1:30 p.m. and proceeded to an overlook into
the Big Room. An obscure route through the breakdown leads
to the floor of the room, but the group was unable to find the
way. An alternate route to the bottom descends eight feet from
a point the South Overlook to a ledge, which leads around and
down to the floor. The cavers had come prepared with a rope
for this climb-down, in case they could not find the route
through the breakdown. A manila rope rigged to a bolt was
present at the eight-foot climb-down when the cavers arrived.
It was tied with loops for use as a rope ladder.
While they were looking for the breakdown route,
Alan Abt decided to descend the climb-down using the
existing rope. He made the descent to the ledge without
incident. John Young was nearby, and was startled to see that
Abt had made the descent using the old rope. Young told Abt
that he should not have used it. While they were talking,
Harrington went around to the climb-down and prepared to
descend. Abt saw him, and told him not to use the old rope.
Harrington either did not hear this or ignored it. He wrapped
the rope around him for a body rappel and started down.
Before Young could speak, the rope broke.
Harrington fell about ten feet to the ledge below,
striking the outermost boulder of the ledge with both feet. He
glanced off the boulder and fell 35 more feet to the breakdown
floor below. His helmet had no chin strap, and came off
during the fall. He landed between two boulders, breaking
both arms and sustaining back and other injuries. He could not
feel anything below his upper torso. The cavers above called
down to Harrington, and after a few moments heard him
moaning.
Young sent the others down to stay with Harrington,
then exited the cave with Jeff Novac. They proceeded to a
nearby house and called for help. Rescuers soon arrived, and
after a difficult 13-hour operation Harrington was carried
from the cave and taken to a hospital. In addition to the
broken limbs, his impact resulted in multiple instantaneous
dislocations of his vertebrae which damaged his spinal cord
without severing it, causing paralysis below the waist.

Comments: Ropes and equipment found in caves are
always suspect and should not be used. Decay causing
microorganisms are common in caves. They can rapidly
weaken and degrade ropes and other equipment without
changing their outward appearance. Do not use ropes or
equipment if you do not know their history. Bring your own.

---------- Page 29 ----------
Manila and other natural fiber ropes are weaker and
more susceptible to decay than nylon ropes of the same size
and are therefore not safe for caving. The rope that broke in
this incident was reported to have been in the cave for no
more than a few months.


********** 8 October
Pettijohns Cave, Georgia
caver fall, injury
Geralyn Devezin entered Pettijohns Cave with six
companions, including Tom Moss, Paul Agarwal, and Jane
Prendergast. The others were experienced cavers, but it was
Devezin's first trip. The group spent about three hours
exploring without incident, and Devezin was doing well and
enjoying the trip. At that point, Devezin, Moss, and Agarwal
decided to head out while the other four continued to explore.
On the way out, Devezin slipped on a six foot flowstone climb
and hyper-extended her knee (heel towards butt). She heard it
pop when she slipped, and felt severe pain in the joint.
Moss gave her 400mg of ibuprofen from his pack
and they continued slowly toward the entrance. Devezin had
difficulty getting through the Z-Bend Crawls, but persevered.
Eventually, the rest of the group caught up with Devezin's
party, and two of the cavers were dispatched to the entrance to
call for assistance.
Devezin's leg was splinted with a rappel rack to
prevent excessive movement and discomfort, and the group
continued. The route involved numerous climbs and crawls
over and through large breakdown, and the group was glad
that they had brought extra hand lines.
Before they had gotten very far, they met up with the
two cavers who had been sent out to call for help and who
were now lost. With Prendergast to lead the way, they started
out once again to call for assistance. The rest of the group
moved slowly onward, helping Devezin as needed as she
crawled towards the surface. They reached the entrance about
4 hours after the accident, just as rescuers arrived. Devezin
was taken to a nearby hospital. Her knee was badly sprained.
Tom Moss, "Incident at Pettijohns", Undergraph Interground,
v7n9/10, September/October 1994, p. 11.
Comments: Devezin's determination and the
assistance of her companions made it possible for her to exit
the cave several hours earlier than she would have had they
simply waited for the rescue. Moss notes that Devezin was
inexperienced and probably getting tired when she fell. He
also notes that the two cavers who were sent for help were not
really known to the others, and were not as experienced as
they appeared. In an emergency, it is usually better to rely on
people whose abilities are known to you.


********** 15 October
Doghill-Donnehue Cave, Indiana
lost
Dan Horner, Tom Geimer, and a teenager named
Ryan entered the Donnehue entrance around 6:00 a.m. They
became lost when they encountered more water trying to exit
than they had seen when they came in.
Their families called authorities when they failed to
return home at 3:00 p.m. Police and firefighters tried to find
the group and were not able to locate them. Bloomington
cavers heard about the rescue and volunteered to help. Six
teams of cavers entered the cave about 10:30 p.m. and found
the group huddled around a candle about 1:00 a.m. They had
plenty of light and food, but could not find the way out. They
were led from the cave and exited after 19 hours underground.

Comments: Inexperience. The cavers were not really
lost - they just didn't think the passage they were in was the
correct one. They had helmet mounted lights with flashlights
for backup.

Greenville Saltpeter Cave, West Virginia
lost, stranded, light failure
Michael Paul Reynolds (25) and John V. Davis (23)
became lost when their lights failed in Greenville Salt Peter
Cave, Monroe County, West Virginia. They entered the cave
with two others, became separated, and were stranded when
their lights failed. Searchers entered the Water and Millpond
entrances and spent hours looking for the men. Eventually a
team entered the Hilltop Entrance, where they found the men a
short distance inside. They had two light sources: a gasoline
lantern and a cigarette lighter. The lantern had been knocked
against a rock, ruining the mantle. They were then unable to
make their way out of the cave with the lighter. They exited
the cave 17 hours after entering. The remainder of the day was
spent recalling the search parties.

2. The Charleston Gazette 17 October 1994, p. 6D.
Comments: Gasoline lanterns are not rugged enough
for use as a caving light. A cigarette lighter does not qualify as
a backup light. Every caver should carry three independent
sources of light. Each one should be adequate to permit a safe
exit from the cave.


********** 15 October
Hughes Cave, Alabama
lost
Mike Pessoney, his son Thomas (15), Brian
Strickland, and his son Nathaniel (15) entered the Hughes
entrance at about 10:00 a.m. planning to make the trip through
the cave and exit via the Foxes Lost entrance. They made it
through the cave and arrived at the wet climb below the
entrance at about 3:30 p.m. They all got wet climbing up into
the upper room. Everyone waited about two and a half hours
while Pessoney searched for the exit. He was directly below
the Foxes Lost Entrance by about 50 feet.

---------- Page 30 ----------
They had left instructions to call for help if they were
not home by 7:00 p.m. Realizing that they could not make
their callout time, they decided to wait where they were. After
an hour, however, they decided go back out through the
Hughes entrance. They were wet, cold, and tired, but felt that
they would be better off moving than sitting. At 7:00 p.m.
they started back, taking about six and a half hours to make
the trip.
They encountered a search party about 300 feet into
the cave from the Hughes entrance. They were out of water
and thirsty, but after receiving water from the rescuers they
were able to exit under their own power after 16 hours
underground.

********** 15 October
Turkey Cave, Virginia
bad air
Benjamin Schwartz, John Murray, Bob Thren, Janice
and Tony Preston, and Ted Andrus entered Turkey Cave,
Rockbridge County, Virginia. The cave had been closed for
several years, but the group had been able to obtain
permission to survey.
The group passed through the Big room and entered
the passageway that leads to a 15-foot drop down to the lower
level. Janice Preston developed a problem breathing only a
few feet into the passage. She negotiated a tight constriction
and then dropped into a small room and regained her breath.
The rest of the group decided her trouble was probably caused
by medicine she had taken earlier that morning.
Murray mentioned he was having trouble keeping his
carbide lamp going. Others were also having with their lamps.
Schwartz was at the rigging point still trying to catch his
breath. He noticed yellow, sooty flames from the carbide
lights, and some of the lights would not stay lit. Everyone in
the group began to experience trouble breathing. They decided
to exit the cave.
Everyone had trouble breathing on the return trip to
the Big Room. Andrus suffered from impaired thinking and
severe difficulty breathing and moving. Once they reached the
Big Room the cavers were able to catch their breath. They left
a sign above the "bad air" passage to warn others of the
danger.
Ted Andrus, "Bad Air Day", The Region Record, Winter
1994, v8n4, p. 5.
Comments: No one in the party had ever run across
bad air before. Symptoms included labored breathing,
dizziness, rapid heartbeat, fatigue, disorientation, and sooty
orange flames on the carbide lamps in the group. The cave
was reported to have bad air in the 1940s, but there had been
no recent reports despite many trips deep into the cave.
A follow-up trip was made on 21 October and an air
quality meter was used to measure the oxygen content at
various points in the cave. Normal air has about 21% oxygen.
The air in the passage where the cavers turned back was found
to measure about 17% oxygen. Levels below 15% are life
threatening.
The oxygen level decreased rapidly as the passage
went deeper. The meter showed no methane present. Had the
cavers descended the 15-foot drop where they stopped, they
might have been unable to climb back out, resulting in
fatalities. Bad air is extremely dangerous, and cavers are
advised to leave immediately when it is suspected.

Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico
rockfall, near-miss
Chuck Crandell, Joel Despain, Kyle Fedderly and
Steve Bumgardner were in Lechuguilla Cave, Carlsbad
Cavern National Park, for a survey trip. While Crandell was
walking up a slope past the Ruby Chamber Pitch, a baseball-
sized rock became dislodged and hit Despain in the foot.
Despain was wearing steel toed boots and the rock dented the
boot toe. At the time, Fedderly was lying face up about three
feet from Despain's feet. It is believed the rock became
dislodged as Crandell was walking up the slope. Despain and
Fedderly did not realize that they were in the rockfall zone.

Comments: Rockfall is always a possibility in caves.
Be aware of the location of other cavers in your party and be
alert for potential rockfall threats.

Fisher Ridge Cave System, Kentucky
acetylene explosion
Tony Mulbrecht, Dave McFarlane and Joe Saunders
entered the Remington Entrance of Fisher Ridge Cave on a
survey trip. While surveying in a low crawl, Mulbrecht was
reading the compass on his belly when his lamp got too close
to his pack. The bottom of his the pack exploded, scattering its
contents and throwing mud into his face. Mulbrecht was
uninjured, SO the cavers fashioned a makeshift pack out of a
pants leg and some boot laces and went on with the trip.
Joe Saunders, "Kentucky Cave Log", DC Speleograph,

Boys Club Camp. Both lights failed soon after they entered,
leaving the boys stranded in darkness. They tried to burn their
T-shirts for warmth. Edwards' father became concerned when
they were late returning home. He drove to the camp and,
unable to locate the boys, called the police. A police dog led
them to the cave. Twenty minutes later, members of the
Bloomington Grotto found the bare-chested boys, cold, wet
and very thirsty.

Comments: Inexperience, inadequate clothing and
equipment, no backup lights.


********** 30 October
Weybridge Cave, Vermont
caver fall, out of control rappel
Tim, Travis, and Jeff (last names unknown, ages
mid-20s) and Jim Bigelow (37) entered Weybridge Cave
expecting to be in the cave for two to three hours The group
negotiated the entrance chimney to the top of the main 45-foot
drop. Travis and Tim rigged the drop. Travis descended and
was followed by Tim.
Jeff started the rappel with the rope passed once
through a standard figure eight descender, but without gloves
or any form of belay. He lost control early in the rappel and
rapidly descended 30 to 35 feet, striking the wall several times
along the way and losing his helmet following an impact close
to the bottom. He was badly shaken but suffered relatively
minor injuries, consisting of rope burns to both hands and
bruises to his thigh and elbow.
First aid was applied to Jeff's hands. Although the
tape made the climb difficult, Jeff made it to the top and
exited the cave with Travis. Tim and Jim de-rigged and exited.

1995, p. 3.
3. James Bigelow, "Accident Report", Vermont Cavers
Association Newsletter, v3n6, December 1994, p. 7.
Comments: Bigelow notes that the lack of gloves
probably contributed to Jeff's inability to control his descent.
The rope was a static line, but was smaller and faster than
ropes that Jeff had previously descended using the figure
eight. Jeff is a large man, and the eight did not provide enough
friction when rigged with only a single pass through the
device. A bottom belay might have prevented or arrested the
loss of control. Belayers must take care to avoid rockfall.
Jeff's helmet probably prevented a head injury, but
should not have come off due to the impact. A UIAA
approved helmet with a quick-release inelastic chin strap is the
best choice for caving protection.


********** 19 November
Millers Cave, Kentucky
lost, inadequate equipment
Nine girls with the High Adventure program of
Buckeye Trails Girl Scout Council entered Millers Cave in
Rockcastle County, Kentucky. They were accompanied by
three adults with prior caving experience, two of whom were
NSS members. Knowing that the cave contained many climbs
with significant exposure the group had brought vertical gear
to rig belays.
About two hours into the cave, the group
encountered a group of Boy Scouts of about the same age.
The boys were uncertain of the route through the confusing
Malfunction Junction, and were not confident that they could
return the way they had come because they had already
descended points that they could not climb in the other
direction. Although they had the assistance of a competent
caver, he was not familiar with the cave. Furthermore, the
boys did not have the equipment to belay the climbs. The Girl
Scout group took them through the cave and out the lower
entrance, loaning them harnesses and belaying when required.
Duane Vore, Incident report, undated.
Comments: Be prepared.


********** 19 November
Ganter Cave, Kentucky
trapped, lost key to gate
A group of eight cavers entered Ganter Cave in
Mammoth Cave National Park after obtaining a permit and the
key from rangers. Once in the cave, they hid their car keys and
the gate key behind a conspicuous rock about forty feet inside
the entrance.
The group explored the cave without incident. Upon
returning to the entrance, they found the car keys undisturbed
but the gate key missing. They were locked in the cave. Since
there was no other group in the cave they decided that a pack
rat had to be the culprit.
The group searched under every rock in the entrance
zone but could not find the key. They knew that the park
rangers would come looking for them if they did not return by
7:00 p.m., SO they decided to sit and wait. At 10:30 p.m. a
large pack rat was spotted. Members of the group followed it
in the hopes that the key would be found, but were
unsuccessful.
Around 11:30 p.m. some of the cavers decided to
look for a second entrance shown on their map. They could
not find it and rejoined the others to wait. One of the cavers
eventually found a weakness in the gate. The cavers managed

---------- Page 32 ----------
to extract themselves with some minor damage to the gate.
They exited at 3:15 a.m. after 18 hours in the cave. They left a
note on the gate that they were out and headed back to the
ranger station.
About one hour later they encountered a park ranger
who was just beginning the hike to the cave to look for them.
The park ranger from the previous day had forgotten to relay
the message to the next shift that there was a group in the
cave.
Glenn Johnson, Incident report, undated.
Comments: Johnson notes that it was not a good idea
to leave the key unprotected. He later learned that the same
thing had happened to some cavers previously. In Mammoth
Cave National Park, where most caves are gated, the regulars
often thread the gate key on a string and wear it like a
necklace.


********** 26 November
Onyx Cave, Arizona
caver fall, injury
While caving with two companions in Onyx Cave,
Clarissa Osborne slipped and slid 30 feet down a 45 degree
slope, injuring her foot when she hit bottom. She was able to
bear some weight on it, though she thought it might be
broken. She exited under her own power, crawling much of
the way and receiving some assistance at a climb. Later
examination revealed that she had torn ligaments and muscle
in the foot.
Steve Knutson, Incident report, undated.


********** 5 December
Lawrence Welk Cave, California
lost
A group of seven teenagers entered Lawrence Welk
Cave to do some exploring. The cave is a talus cave,
consisting of a 400 foot deep canyon filled with boulders. A
stream runs along the bottom of the canyon through the cave.
There are several entrances along the canyon.
As the group was exploring the middle section of the
cave they decided to split into two groups. One group of three
headed up the canyon and out of the cave and to the car where
the two groups were to meet by 5:00 p.m. The other group of
four headed downstream where they became lost in the maze
of boulders.
When the second group did not return to the vehicles,
a callout was made and a large search and rescue operation
ensued. Eventually, a three man team of cavers found the
group when one of the rescuers heard their voices down a
small passage. The teens had heard the voices and helicopters
all day during the search, but could not make contact or find
the way out. The place they picked to wait was warm and dry
SO they were able to sit in relative comfort and wait for help.
1. Tom Gilleland, Incident report, undated.
2. David Decker, Incident report, undated.
3. Lisa Petrillo, "4 boys lost in N. County cave rescued", San
Diego Union Tribune, 6 December 1994.
Comments: Inexperience. The large-scale search and
rescue operation was hampered by the lack of integration of
cavers with local rescue groups. It helps to establish those
relationships in advance.


********** 11 December
Manitou Cave, Colorado
rockfall, injury
Mark Molberg was injured when a falling rock
briefly pinned his leg in a dig in Williams Canyon's Manitou
Cave. Molberg was in a line of cavers passing buckets of dirt,
rocks and other debris from the face of the Deepwater section
dig, when he was pinned by a large rock that fell from the
ceiling of the passage. Members of the group quickly pried the
rock off and Molberg was able to exit the cave without
assistance. At first it was thought that Molberg only suffered
from bruising, however he later found that he had also
sustained some ligament damage.
Richard Rhinehart, "Caver Injured in Manitou Cave Dig",
Rocky Mountain Caving, v12n1, Winter 1995, pp. 4-5.
Comments: Rhinehart notes that one of the
contributing factors was thought to be the use of novice cavers
who had little or no caving experience. He suggests that more
experienced cavers might not have removed a chock stone that
held up the larger rock that later fell, or they might have
insisted on cleaning up the passage to remove any dangerous
rocks or on installing shoring for additional protection.


********** 12 December
Reeves Cave, Indiana
lost, light failure, inadequate equipment
Two men from Bloomington decided to take a short
trip into a small cave they had heard about. When they could
not find it, they entered Reeves Cave instead. They had been
given the location by a gas station attendant.
They had one flashlight each, with no spare bulbs or
batteries, and were not wearing helmets. The men left their
jackets a few hundred feet into the cave and continued. They
soon found themselves lost. When their flashlight batteries ran
out they were stranded without food, water, light, or adequate
clothing.
When the men did not return home on Sunday,
family members contacted law enforcement officials who in
turn contacted local cavers to help. The men were found about
3,000 feet into the cave, uninjured, but suffering from mild
hypothermia. They spent 45 hours in the cave.

Normal News, v5n1, January 1995, p. 9.
2. Associated Press report, Louisville Courier Journal, 14
December 1994.
Comments: Inexperience, inadequate equipment, no
backup lights, poor judgment. Mirza reports that they tracked
the men by the trail of Marlboro cigarette butts and the

---------- Page 33 ----------
remains of the bats they had killed along the way. The
rescuers informed the owner about the bats and pointed out
that the Indiana cave protection law allowed him to file
charges, but he declined to do SO. He did however, ask the
men never to return.


********** 17 December
Cass Cave, West Virginia
dropped equipment, acetylene hazard
Five cavers from Ohio entered Cass Cave, descended
the 185-foot drop, and explored the cave. Jerry Galbraith was
the first to ascend. His pack became snagged near the top,
tearing the shoulder strap loose. Galbraith yelled "Rock!" as
the pack fell 165 feet, hit a ledge, and bounced sideways,
narrowly missing Jason Glancy on the bottom.
Glancy was the next to climb, followed by Mike
Liston. Each carried some of Galbraith's gear up to him. The
group de-rigged and began to exit the cave. While in a low
stream crawl Galbraith's pack became flooded. The pack
contained a large amount of carbide, which produced a
dangerous amount of acetylene gas in the confined space.
Duane Galbraith yelled for everyone to extinguish their lights.
There was no explosion and the group exited the cave.
Mike Liston, Incident report, undated.


********** 21 December
Safford Shafts, Arizona
explosion, entrapment
Branden Silverhorn, Christopher Reed (18), Gus A.
Hansen, John P. Salazar, and Jeremy Platt went to the Safford
Shafts, also known as Red Knolls. The area contains a series
of 40 to 60 foot deep pits in the raised bed of an ancient lake.
A four foot thick cap rock layer overlays 60 feet of silt. The
five arrived at 9:00 p.m. and climbed up to the area just a few
yards from the edge of the cliffs facing the road.
They dropped about four gallons of gasoline down a
fissure about a foot square. They then ignited a rag and threw
it down the hole. This caused a "geyser like" explosion,
opening up the fissure to about six feet by twelve feet,
throwing four of the men back and sending Branden
Silverhorn 40 feet down, where he was buried under rocks
and dirt capped by a three foot by five foot slab.
Three of the group went to the car and headed to
town to get help. Rescuers rigged a tripod over the hole and
where eventually able to maneuver Silverhorn out of the hole.
He was brought up at 8:27 a.m. The rescue effort took over
eleven and a half hours. Silverhorn's injuries included a
broken leg, kidney failure, and hypothermia. He was taken to
Tucson Medical Center. The other members of the group
sustained lacerations and abrasions. One young man suffered
a sprained ankle and a fractured left wrist.
Mike Johansen, "Man rescued from 40 foot deep hole",
Eastern Arizona Courier, 21 December 1994, p. 1.
Comments: Extremely poor judgment.


********** 26 December
Spanish Moss Cave, Utah
stranded on rope, exhaustion
Dan Clyde led two novice cavers, Pat and Bud
Snedecor, to Spanish Moss Cave near Provo, Utah. The
entrance is vertical for about 80 feet. The top 40 feet descends
as a narrow, wet, but climbable passage. The bottom 40 feet is
a free hang, dropping into the main passage room of the cave.
After the group explored the cave, Pat Snedecor was
the first one out. Bud Snedecor made it only half way up the
40-foot free hang before exhaustion stopped his progress.
Clyde, who was still at the bottom of the cave told Pat
Snedecor to go get another group of cavers who he knew were
visiting Red Baron Cave across the canyon. When the Red
Baron group descended to the canyon floor, they encountered
Pat Snedecor who told them that Bud Snedecor was stuck half
way up the pit and could not go up or down. They agreed to
help, and followed Pat Snedecor to the cave.
While the group on the surface was assembling a
hauling system, Clyde, still on the bottom, talked Bud
Snedecor into rigging his figure 8 descender. Clyde ascended
to Snedecor and helped him remove his ascenders and rappel
back to the floor. Snedecor weighed about 250 pounds, SO
they decided to use a 4:1 hauling system to pull him out.
Snedecor was hauled up the 40-foot drop and was belayed
while he climbed the remainder of the way out.
Kevin Dickerson, Incident report, undated.
Comments: A nice example of small group self-
rescue. It would appear that Snedecor did not have sufficient
practice with his ascending system before the trip.
Late 1994
unnamed cave in the Berkshires, Massachusetts
rockfall
Larry Botto and Frank Harrington were digging in a
cave discovered a few days earlier at the bottom of a large
sink. They began digging and gained entrance by collapsing
the breakdown into the cave. They could see into a larger
room about 15 feet below, but needed some shoring before
proceeding. They jammed tree limbs wherever they could to
hold back the loose rocks. In the process, Harrington "was
nearly flat-rocked by a 500 pound rock that slid off the
surrounding bedrock wall, but luckily sidestepped it." Several
days later the pair returned to continue the dig. As Botto was
entering the cave, "a 300 pound piece of what I thought was
bedrock came off in my hand and landed smack dab across the
entrance of the cave."
Larry Botto, "More Berkshire Digging", Northeastern Caver,
March 1995, pp. 6-7.
Comments: Sometimes the cave is trying to tell you
something.

********** 8 January
Cookston Cave, Tennessee
rockfall entrapment
Clinton Ferrell (25) and a friend were searching for
artifacts in the cave when a 500-pound rock shifted and
pinned his head against the wall. He was unable to free
himself, SO his friend went for help. Cave rescue personnel
from Sequatchie and Hamilton Counties responded. Ferrell
and the boulder were stabilized, and a come-along was used to
move the boulder enough to free him. He was placed in a
litter, hauled up a 100-foot slope, and airlifted to the hospital
where he was listed in critical condition, but expected to
recover.

as a result of the incident.


********** 8 January
Sunny Jims Cave, California
washed into sea cave, stranded
Veteran surfer Lyle Smith (24) was washed into the
submerged entrance of Sunny Jims Cave while trying to take
advantage of a period of unusually large waves in La Jolla
Cove. He surfaced in an air filled chamber which is part of a
commercial cave connected to the La Jolla Cave and Shell
Shop. Bruised and bloodied from being dashed against rocks
and barnacles, Smith felt his way along a man-made
connecting tunnel and up 145 steps to the back door of the
shell shop. He pounded on the locked door until he was heard
and released. Smith was treated for multiple cuts and bruises
to his hands, feet, and back. He was reported to have said:
"I'm bummed that I didn't get to surf the big waves, but very
happy I didn't get hurt worse."

********** 13 January
Barberry Cave, Virginia
flood entrapment
Mike Ficco, Ben Schwartz, Tommy Shifflett, Mike
Artz, and Nevin Davis entered Barberry Cave on Friday,
January 13. They carried food and supplies for a multi-day
camp and planned to spend several days surveying. About 30
minutes into the cave there is a 114-foot long excavated low-
airspace crawlway. The weather forecast was reported to be
scattered showers.
Sometime Saturday, a four inch deluge produced a
flood which washed mud and gravel into the crawlway,
reducing its size substantially and creating a sump.
The cavers were awakened on Sunday by the sound
of high water. Their camp was located in a large dry passage
about 3/4 mile from the entrance and they felt that they were
in no danger. However, they did decide to ration food in case
they became unable to exit on Monday as planned. On
Monday morning they proceeded to the entrance where they
discovered the sumped passage. They returned to camp to wait
for the water level to go down.
By Tuesday morning the water had dropped to
produce about two inches of airspace, but the mud fill had
reduced the passage size. Ficco and Schwartz (the smallest
two) had done the original excavation of the passage and were
able to dig their way out, but the larger cavers could not fit.
Their plan was for Ficco and Schwartz to exit, check the
weather, and either return with more supplies or get some rest
and come back Wednesday morning to dig out the others, who
would return to camp and wait.
When Ficco and Schwartz exited, they found a large
rescue operation in progress. After some discussion, they were
allowed to return to the cave mid-morning Wednesday and
continue their excavation. The remaining cavers were freed by
late afternoon.

Comments: The rescuers were called by the families
and friends of the cavers. Once initiated, such operations
usually grow rapidly and attract media attention. The trapped
cavers felt that only a small group of experienced cavers was
needed to support and assist in their digging efforts, and were
surprised at the size of the rescue response. Unfortunately,
rescue and emergency response agencies and organizations
are bound by legal and societal constraints to provide a
response adequate to the worst case scenario. Having no
information about the condition of the trapped cavers, they
had to assume the worst and respond accordingly or risk being
held liable for a bad outcome. It appears that the response was
not unreasonable given the situation and the information
available outside the cave.
It was reported that the rescuers were reluctant to let
Ficco and Schwartz re-enter the cave to continue their
digging, preferring to let a fresh team work on the silted
passage. This appears to have delayed the exit of the

---------- Page 35 ----------
remaining cavers. The cave was closed as a result of the
incident.


********** 24 January
Grindstone Cave, Tennessee
stranded in pit, no equipment
Five youths (ages 16-18 years) entered Grindstone
Cave on Monday afternoon. The cave has a 20-foot entrance
pit which is easily climbed due to its small diameter. Using a
piece of utility rope as a hand line, all but one of the youths
were able to make the climb and exit. Ryan Sides (18) became
exhausted in his attempt to exit and became sick. He remained
at the bottom while the others went for help. The cave rescue
team responded and the boy was pulled out with a Z-rig haul
system. He was uninjured. The boys received a lecture on safe
caving techniques and an invitation to the local grotto
meeting.

2. "Crew pulls man from cave", The Chattanooga Times, 25
January 1995, p. B3.
Comments: Improper clothing, no equipment, no
training or experience. The rope used by the youths was an
old one left rigged by earlier explorers. When rescuers were
cleaning the site after the rescue, they discovered that though
one end was tied to a tree near the entrance, the rope had been
severed between the tree and the pit. The rope was buried in
the dirt, and a campfire built on top of it had burned through
it. It was supported only by the friction of the overlying dirt.
This serves as an excellent reminder that rescuers should
always rig their own ropes and equipment. Ropes and
equipment placed by unknown parties should be viewed with
a healthy suspicion.
January
Cemetery Pit, Georgia
rockfall, broken leg
Peter Hontazs and five other cavers descended the
153-foot entrance drop in Cemetery Pit and proceeded to the
Rockeaters Extension area of the cave. While looking for the
route onward, Hontazs attempted to climb some breakdown,
which collapsed. A large boulder struck his right leg causing a
compound fracture just above the ankle. He also suffered a
deep tear on his left hand while trying to brace himself as the
boulder fell.
After examining the injuries, two cavers left to get
more rope and re-rig the entrance pit for the rescue. The others
began helping Hontazs back toward the entrance. En-route
they encountered the first two cavers, who had become lost.
Hontazs walked, crawled, and was carried to the bottom of the
entrance pit, taking about seven hours for the journey, which
normally takes less than one hour.
At the entrance pit, the cavers rigged a counterweight
system using two cavers for ballast and hauled Hontazs up and
out of the pit. He was carried down the mountain and taken to
the hospital and has since recovered.
Bubba Geyer, Accident report, undated.
Comments: The cavers did a good job with a difficult
situation. The counterweight haul system is often useful in
small group and self rescues. Hontazs would probably not
have gotten out any sooner had he waited for a rescue from
outside.


********** 3 February
Grassy Cove Saltpeter Cave, Tennessee
caver fall, multiple injuries
Matt Gore (19) and two companions entered Grassy
Cove Saltpeter Cave at 6:00 p.m. on Friday evening. They
proceeded about 7,200 feet into the cave, arriving at the
Waterfall Room around midnight. While attempting to climb
down the pit to the base of the waterfall, Gore apparently
dislodged some rocks which struck him and caused him to fall
to the bottom of the 60-foot deep pit. He suffered skull and
facial fractures, an epidural hematoma, two dislocated fingers,
and neck and shoulder injuries.
His companions left their equipment at the top of the
pit and free-climbed to the bottom to try to help him. At the
bottom of the pit their lights failed, leaving them all in total
darkness. They waited for three hours until one managed to
climb back up using a Bic lighter as a light source. Once on
top, he sent fresh batteries, a blanket, and a stove down to the
friend who would remain with Gore. It took him another three
hours to exit the cave and call for help at 7:00 a.m.
Local and regional rescue groups responded,
including cave rescue teams. Gore was brought out of the cave
at 7:42 p.m. and flown to a hospital where he was later
reported to be in stable condition.

Comments: The "cavers" were not wearing helmets,
did not have proper lights or equipment, and had no training
or experience in proper caving technique. They did not tell
anyone where they were going. Climbing down the pit and
leaving their equipment at the top very nearly left them all
stranded indefinitely. Gore would probably not have survived.
Backup lights are useless if you don't keep them with you.
Many cavers mount two lights on their helmets for this reason.


********** 11 February
McClendons Cave, Alabama
lost, stranded, light failure
Three local men entered McClendons cave without
permission on a Saturday. They used a knotted rope to
descend the 40-foot entrance pit. One decided to explore on
his own and became separated from the others. While

---------- Page 36 ----------
exploring alone, he dropped his only light source, a lantern.
He spent the next three hours in the dark. His companions
were unable to find him and exited to call for help. Local
cavers were notified and soon arrived to help search. The lost
caver was found about 30 minutes into the cave, scared but
uninjured.
Tonya Smothers, "McClendons Cave Rescue", TAG-Net
#338, 16 February 1995.
Comments: Inadequate equipment and poor
technique. Lanterns are fragile and unsuitable for caving.
Cavers should carry two backup lights. Doing a 40-foot pit
hand-over-hand on knotted rope is dangerous and unsafe. The
lost caver was reportedly in possession of marijuana, which
may have been a contributing factor. He apologized to the
landowner and promised never to return. The owner was
reported to be considering closing the cave.


********** 13 February
Doghill-Donnehue Cave, Indiana
caver fall, injury
A caver named Shelly (last name and age unknown)
fell and injured her foot near the connection area of Doghill-
Donnehue Cave. One of her party members exited and called
local cavers for help at 5:45 a.m. Based on the information
supplied, the cavers decided to initiate a small group rescue
and call for more help later if needed.
The responding cavers, including an EMT, reached
the injured woman at about 7:25 a.m. and examined her foot,
concluding that she had probably broken one or more of the
metatarsal bones. The rescuers treated Shelly for hypothermia,
splinted her foot, and helped her through the cave, carrying
her when possible. They reached the entrance at about 11:00
a.m. Shelly was driven to the hospital, where she was found to
have pulled tendons in her foot, but no broken bones.
Anmar Mirza, Incident report, 15 February 1995.
Comments: Mirza reports that Shelly was exhausted
by time she reached the entrance due to hypothermia, exertion,
and lack of food and drink. He suggests carrying some form
of liquid nourishment in your pack if you are among the first
responders to an accident. A small backpacking stove can be
used to prepare hot drinks which can revive cold, tired cavers
or at least make the wait for help more bearable. Extra
clothing for the patient and her party would also be good.
Mirza also notes that the rescue was 'low profile'. It
involved only 5 cavers assisting the members of the original
party, and did not attract any news coverage. Mirza made the
decision for limited response based on his knowledge of the
cave and the patient's relatively minor injury.
February
Hurricane Cave, Colorado
injury
Three cavers were attempting to find the connection
between the highest and middle entrances of this high relief,
alpine cave in granite. After hiking about one kilometer
through snow, they rappelled the very wet entrance pit and
started exploration.
Louise Hose was wearing thin polypropylene liner
gloves under stouter rubber gloves. While working on her
carbide lamp and performing other tasks during the trip, she
removed both pairs of gloves and was not careful to ensure
that her hands were clean when she replaced the gloves.
Because of the near-freezing temperature in the cave, Hose
did not notice when her hands received numerous abrasions
on the fingers. Apparently sand inside the polypropylene
gloves rubbed against the wet, tender skin and abraded deep
wounds on the sides of her fingers. She did not notice the
injuries until she removed the gloves and started to warm her
hands. The wounds were cleaned and dressed when
discovered, but took several weeks to heal.
Louise Hose, Incident report, 31 October 1996.
Comments: Hose notes that the main cause was her
failure to clean her hands before donning the gloves, and that
you have to be more careful about such things in a cold cave
when the skin can be numbed. Wet skin is also more
susceptible to injury. She suggests that wearing surgical
gloves as liners might provide protection while preserving
dexterity.


********** 4 March
Pettijohns Cave, Georgia
caver fall, injury
Ricky Rawlins (34), Terri Rawlins, and Wayne
Kester were exploring Pettijohns Cave and were exiting the
Volcano Room via a climb through breakdown. While
handing a cave pack up the climb, Ricky Rawlins slipped and
dislocated his shoulder. He did not feel that he would be able
to exit unassisted, SO Terri Rawlins remained with him while
Kester exited and called for help. Cave rescue personnel
responded and a paramedic on the team was able to reduce the
dislocation at the scene. Ricky Rawlins then exited the cave
with their assistance. He was belayed on all climbs during his
exit.

Real Well, Tennessee
stranded on rope, hypothermia, fatality
Andrew Fust (32) and Attila Szedmohradszky (26)
rappelled the 160-foot entrance pit of Real Well in extremely
wet conditions. A large waterfall was flowing in the pit, and
their rope was rigged directly in the water. They were not
wearing wetsuits. Szedmohradszky was not wearing a helmet.
After caving for about half an hour, Szedmohradszky
began to feel uncomfortable and wished to exit. He rigged a
climbing system consisting of a commercial seat harness,
hand-tied chest harness, one Petzl handled ascender, and a
Petzl Shunt. The handled ascender was attached to his harness
by a long cow's tail and a chain of six non-locking carabiners.
The Shunt was attached to a long foot sling.

---------- Page 37 ----------
Szedmohradszky climbed some distance up the pit,
but began to have difficulty with the Shunt. He yelled to Fust
that he was replacing it with a prusik knot. He made the
change and began climbing again, but more slowly than
before. After about 40 minutes he stopped climbing about
halfway up the pit, hanging in the full force of the water. He
tried to communicate with Fust, but could not be understood.
Fust called to him and told him to change over and
rappel back down. After about 30 minutes, Fust heard him say
clearly, "I can't!" Fust then got on rope and climbed up to and
past Szedmohradszky, who was conscious but unable to move.
Fust attempted to execute a pick off, but was unable to
complete the maneuver and rappel back down. He then tried
to climb out with Szedmohradszky tethered to his harness, but
was able to ascend only 15 feet before becoming exhausted.
Both cavers were now stuck on rope, hanging in the waterfall
without wetsuits or other protective clothing.
As a last resort, Fust swung over to a ledge and got
out of his seat harness to get off rope. He was shaking
uncontrollably, and retreated to a dryer area on the ledge
where he passed out. Regaining consciousness some hours
later, he was able to re-rig his equipment and cut the tether to
Szedmohradszky, who was by then apparently dead. Fust then
climbed out of the cave and called for help.
Cave rescue personnel responded and found
Szedmohradszky's body still hanging on rope in the waterfall.
A doctor on the team examined him and noted that he had
been dead for many hours. The body was recovered without
difficulty. An autopsy revealed that he had died of
hypothermia.

3. Beena Hyatt, "Caver found suspended in dark pit", The
Hustler, South Pittsburg, Tennessee, v96n12, 23 March
1995, pp. 1,13.
Comments: Szedmohradszky was reported to have
visited only five caves previously. He had no wetsuit and no
helmet and was using an unsafe, pieced-together climbing
system. From his position on rope and the configuration of his
equipment, rescuers concluded that he became stranded when
one of the six non-locking carabiners he was using in a chain
to attach his seat ascender became unhooked. He was left
hanging by the cow's tail sling, which was SO long that he
could not reach the ascender. The prusik knot was also out of
reach.
Chains of carabiners should not be used to attach
ascenders to a climber's harness. Use a sling or a cow's tail
for that purpose, with a single carabiner or quick link at each
end. The attachment slings should not be SO long that they
leave the climber unable to reach the ascenders.
Both cavers should have been wearing helmets and
wetsuits or other protective clothing. Fust reports that they had
wetsuits, but left them in the car. It appears that neither caver
was sufficiently experienced or prepared for a wet vertical
cave. The pick off maneuver that Fust attempted allows a
caver on rope to lower a stranded companion to the bottom of
a drop. It is an important self rescue tool for vertical cavers. It
requires practice, however, before you can expect to use it in a
waterfall in the dark.


********** 29 March
Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico
difficulty on rope, equipment problem
A team of four cavers was exiting Lechuguilla Cave
after a five day exploration and mapping trip. When Donald
Davis began his ascent of the 145-foot Boulder Falls pit, using
a three-Gibbs ropewalker system, his knee and foot ascenders
failed simultaneously to grip the rope. He was stranded a few
feet off the floor. Using an emergency prusik sling for his feet,
Davis was able to complete the ascent in about a hour. The
foot ascender later failed again at the 65-foot entrance pit.
Donald Davis, Incident report, undated.
Comments: Davis notes that the ascenders were
about 30 years old. By his description, the cams were
apparently extremely worn. They worked well enough on
dirty ropes deep in the cave, but slipped on the newer, cleaner
ropes near the entrance. It is a good idea to check and replace
worn equipment before a big trip or expedition. Ascender
cams need to be checked and replaced periodically. Gibbs
cams should be replaced when wear is evident beyond the
fourth tooth. Cams worn beyond this point will often slip.
March
unnamed dig, Vermont
rockfall, near-miss
While digging in a small cave in Vermont, a caver
was nearly crushed when a boulder the size of a small
refrigerator broke loose and fell toward him. Disaster was
averted by a companion, who saw the rock start to move and
grabbed the digger by the collar, pulling him to safety. The
digger had dislodged the rock by pulling on a root in the
passageway.

March
Los Juanitos, Mexico
bad air
The fourth expedition to Los Juanitos encountered
bad air 600 feet below the entrance, as on the previous
expeditions. Based on observation of the performance of a
cigarette lighter, the cavers concluded that the oxygen content
was below 17%. The cavers had brought oxygen cylinders to
use at depth, but decided not to proceed.
Jonathan Smith and Steve Ford, "Exploration of Los
Juanitos", NSS News, v53n10, October 1995, pp. 271-272.
Comments: See the summary and comments from the
March 22, 1994 incident in the same cave. Entering a cave or
other confined space with a hazardous atmosphere present
requires special training and equipment. Even with air packs
or air lines it is dangerous. Cavers should not attempt it.

---------- Page 38 ----------
Oxygen cylinders are not a substitute for SCBA air packs. In
addition to low oxygen content, bad air in caves may contain
toxic gases.


********** 6 April
Clarksville Cave, New York
caver fall, injury
Mike Young led a group of 10 Westfield State
College geology students on a trip into Clarksville Cave. It
was the first caving experience for all ten students. On their
way out of the cave they were about 100 yards upstream from
the Big Room when Kelly Morrisey (20) bumped her helmet
hard against the cave ceiling and lost her balance. She slipped
on the muddy surface and fell, dislocating her knee. Young
reached Morrisey about one minute after the accident. He
decided to have her remain still and that help was needed.
Leaving the other students with Morrisey, Young
took two students and exited the cave via the Ward Entrance.
A space blanket was left to keep Morrisey warm. Once out,
Young sent a student to a nearby restaurant to summon
assistance. He left the students at the parking area to direct
rescuers to the cave, and reentered the cave carrying a heavy
wool blanket for Morrisey.
Rescue personnel soon arrived. Morrisey's leg was
splinted and she was placed in a SKED litter. The whole
group assisted in carrying her from the cave. Sometime during
this process the dislocation reduced itself. Morrisey was taken
to a hospital, where x-rays showed no broken bones.
Thom Engel, "Incident at Clarksville Cave", incident report
edited and expanded from a report by Mike Young, undated.
Comments: Morrisey was a first-time caver, and was
reported to have had problems with her knee prior to the trip.
The group was equipped with helmets, but most did not have
helmet mounted lights and were carrying flashlights. A helmet
mounted light leaves your hands free to avert a slip or fall.
Young should probably have taken someone with him when
he reentered the cave.


********** 8 April
Salamander Cave, Indiana
flood entrapment
Ronald Erb (19) and Elizabeth Hershman (19), both
students at the University of Indiana, were trapped in
Salamander Cave for 15 hours when a storm cell dropped over
three inches of rain in the area. Rescuers were summoned
when neighbors reported that the pair had not exited after they
were seen entering the cave earlier in the afternoon. The
rescuers were already in the area, having been called to nearby
Trapdoor Cave when four people and two dogs were reported
trapped by flooding.
The combination of the two flooding incidents
provoked a massive response from rescue workers and the
media. Cave rescue personnel were able to persuade
authorities to wait for the water to recede rather than risking
the lives of divers. By Sunday morning the water was down
enough that a group of cavers was able to enter and bring out
the stranded students, who had been waiting out the flood in a
large room several hundred feet into the cave.

cave", Bloomington Herald-Times, Sunday, 9 April 1995,

3. Sara Brazeal, "Rapid flooding traps IU students in cave",
Indiana Daily Student, 11 April 1995.
4. Anmar Mirza, Incident report, 9 April 1995.
Comments: Mirza noted that the two students were
ill-equipped for caving, lacking helmets and carrying only
flashlights. They had been told by a friend that the cave
doesn't flood. In fact, flooding of the lower levels is well
known to experienced local cavers. In 1975 three people
drowned in the cave under similar circumstances when they
tried to exit through the water rather than wait it out. Mirza
notes that the danger in this cave is that the flood waters tend
to sweep cavers down a side passage and into a sump.
When a safe area is available it is usually best for
trapped cavers to wait out a flood rather than to fight the water
and risk being swept into a sump and drowned. In most flood
entrapments, the best course of action for rescuers is also to
wait for the water to go down rather than risk the lives of
divers and other rescuers. It is sometimes difficult for trained
cave rescue personnel to convince local authorities and
distraught family members that this is the best thing to do.
This rescue was complicated by uncertainty as to
how many people were in the cave and the possibility that
they might actually be in one of several other caves nearby.
Consequently, those caves had to be checked as well.


********** 8 April
Trapdoor Cave, Indiana
flood entrapment
Timothy Baker (17), Josh Baker (12), Nick Fizette
(18), Aaron Lancaster (21), Derek Lancaster (26), and two
dogs named Blackie and Socks were exploring Trapdoor Cave
when they noticed the water rising rapidly. The cave is close
to Salamander cave and was being flooded by the same storm
cell. Derek Lancaster raced for the entrance and was able to
make it out before it sumped. He went to a nearby house and
called for help. The others were trapped in the cave and
retreated to a dry area to wait. A large rescue operation
ensued, but was of little help until the water level dropped
during a lull in the storm. Taking advantage of the
opportunity, a caver entered and was able to escort everyone
out one at a time. He also retrieved the two dogs. During the
evacuation the rain resumed and the water level began to rise.
The evacuation was completed just before the water reached
its earlier flood level.

Comments: The group was trapped for about four
hours. They did not have helmets or other proper caving
equipment.


********** 29 April
Snail Shell Cave, Tennessee
stranded, inadequate equipment
Three men attempted to explore Snail Shell Cave
using an inflatable raft to negotiate the flooded upstream
passage, which extends for about 2,500 feet with water depths
exceeding 10 feet. They each had one flashlight and were not
wearing wetsuits or personal flotation devices. They managed
to get about halfway through the passage before puncturing
the raft on a rock projection. As it deflated, the three men
swam to the side and managed to climb up into a breakdown
room. One was a strong swimmer and volunteered to try to
swim out using a mini-mag flashlight for light. Fortunately, he
made it out and was able to call for help. He then headed back
in with another raft. By the time rescuers arrived the group
was exiting the cave.
Don Lance, "Rescue at Snail Shell Cave", TAG-Net #411, 5
May 1995.
Comments: Inexperience, inadequate equipment, and
poor judgment. The swimmer was lucky that his flashlight
didn't fail during his exit. If it had, he might have drowned.
Experienced cavers wear full wetsuits and take personal
flotation devices when exploring this cave. They also take
proper caving lights and carry backup lights. Two of the men
claimed to be former NSS members.


********** 30 April
Helens Cave, New Mexico
caver fall, injury
John Leland (35), Leslie Gilkie (32), Ken Keeling
(53), Sharon Chong (39), and Jackie Garcia (age unknown)
rappelled into the entrance of Helens Cave and spent three
hours exploring. They began to exit, taking turns free-
climbing the 30-foot entrance drop using a Jumar on the
rappel line as a safety. Chong was the third person to climb.
When she reached the lip, she had difficulty finding holds and
held on to the Jumar with her right hand as she moved up.
Suddenly, she lost her footing and fell. The Jumar failed to
engage and slipped on the rope, allowing her to fall 20 feet to
the bottom.
Chong struck her lower back on the right side when
she landed. Her backpack helped cushion the fall, but she
became stuck in a crevice. She was quickly freed by Leland,
and felt that she would be able to climb out. She rigged a
second Jumar with a foot loop and climbed out without
incident. She suffered bruises and abrasions on her back,
shoulder, and arm.
Sharon Chong, Accident report, undated.
Comments: Chong notes that the Jumar was the
yellow model with the hand grip. The rope was an 11mm
dynamic climbing rope with a worn, fuzzy sheath. She
speculates that the failure of the Jumar to grip the rope could
have been due to the use of worn dynamic rope. Another
possibility is that her hand was pulling on the ascender in a
way that prevented the cam from functioning properly.
Jumar ascenders are not really designed to be used as
a belay device to catch falls, and may not be reliable when
used for that purpose. Chong notes that a better option would
have been to have one of the people at the top give her a
conventional belay. Another would have been to simply climb
the rope using standard vertical technique.
April
Black Cave, Arizona
solo caving, lost, light failure, fatality
Thomas Edward Benning entered Black Cave on a
solo exploration trip in April, 1995. He had been in the cave
several times before. He had no helmet, but was carrying an
electric miner's lamp. He entered the cave and went down a
somewhat obscure passage leading out of the entrance room.
About an hour into the cave, he left the normal travel
route and went through a crawl into an area of unexplored
cave. It is believed that he had become lost and was searching
for the way out. At some point his lamp failed. He left it in the
passage and apparently attempted to make his way out using
matches for light. When these were exhausted, he apparently
continued his search in the dark. He left various objects in the
passages as he went, possibly to mark the route as he searched
for the exit passage. Eventually, he climbed down into a tight,
four-foot deep fissure where he became stuck.
When Benning did not return home by the next day,
his wife called the police and reported him missing. About 24
hours after the report was made, his vehicle was located at the
parking spot for Black Cave and several other smaller caves.
The area was searched and his shirt and sunglasses were
found in the entrance room of Black Cave. Local search and
rescue teams were sent to the cave several times, but they
were not familiar with the cave and did not find the opening
leading to Benning. Cavers were never notified or called to
help in the search.
On December 14, 1996, Bill Graff, Elizabeth Robb,
and Dale Green entered the cave. It was Graff's second trip to
the cave, and he was leading the way. About an hour into their
trip they came upon a book of matches lying in the
passageway. All the matches and the book itself had been
burned. About eight feet further down the passage they found
a Wheat Lamp. It was inoperative. In a nearby side passage
they noticed a set of keys, the insole from a shoe, a torn trash
bag, some clothing torn into strips, and a straw. They thought
this was strange, but did not investigate further at the time.
The cavers continued their trip, returning to the area
about three hours later on their way out. They decided to
explore the passage where the keys had been found, which
was about three feet wide and 18 inches high. Robb led the
way, following the air flow to the right at a fork. She found a
shoe in the passage, then a sock. A short distance further she
came upon what appeared at first to be a clump of fur. Upon
closer inspection it turned out to be the head of a body
wedged in a crevice in the passage floor. The body appeared

---------- Page 40 ----------
to have been in the cave for quite some time, and was
mummified to a great extent. The cavers photographed the
body and the area, took the keys for use in identification, and
left the cave, leaving reflective markers to indicate the route
back to the body.
They reported the discovery to the sheriff's office. A
deputy small enough to fit through the cave was sent to
accompany them back to the site for a preliminary
investigation. The deputy was unable to fit into the crevice, SO
Robb took additional photographs while the deputy examined
the scene. Taking the shoe, lamp, and other items for
evidence, they left the cave.
A body recovery operation was initiated, and the
cavers volunteered to assist. Additional cavers were called in
from outside the county. The recovery was complicated by the
tight passage and the mummification of the body, and required
three more trips into the cave. Benning was identified when
his wallet was found in the crevice during the body recovery.
1. Bill Graff, "Death in Black Cave", Incident report,
undated.
2. Ray Keeler, Incident report, 13 January 1997.
3. Elizabeth Robb, personal communication, 26 February
1997.
Comments: Benning told his wife that he was "going
caving," but did not say where. He was discovered about 20
months after he entered the cave. The passage he took is
hidden by a large rock a short distance into the cave and was
not found by the searchers. Benning was in a fairly remote
area off the normal route.
Cavers were aware of the cave and had quietly been
mapping it for some time. It was a "secret" project, SO maps
and information were not generally available. The cave owner
was reported to have been unaware of the cave until the body
was discovered. No cavers were notified or involved in the
original search in April 1995. Some of the searchers were
reported to have had experience in mines, but not caves.
It is a good idea to let someone know where you are
going, and to carry backup lights adequate to allow you to
safely exit the cave. Solo caving is generally not a good idea.
It is unknown how long Benning was trapped before he died.
It is possible that he was still alive when searchers found his
shirt in the entrance. Had cavers been called in at that point,
with their map, experience, and knowledge of the cave, it is
possible that Benning might have been found alive and
rescued.


********** 14 May
Hunters Cave, Iowa
asphyxiation, smoke bomb in cave
Neil Crider (19), his friend Lucas Thomsen (18), his
brother Charles Crider (21) and Andy Cornwell (21), entered
Hunters Cave for an afternoon of exploring. A short distance
into the cave, Cornwell set off a military smoke grenade,
apparently as a practical joke. Smoke from the grenade
quickly filled the passage. The men were unable to see and
were nearly overcome by the smoke and fumes. Realizing his
friends were in trouble, Cornwell left the cave, soaked his
shirt in a nearby stream, and held it over his face as he
reentered. Holding on to each other, they were able to crawl
out to the surface, where they were racked by nausea and
vomiting. Charles Crider continued to have difficulty
breathing, SO the others rushed him to a nearby store and
called for an ambulance. He was taken to a hospital and
placed in intensive care. All four of the men suffered from
smoke inhalation.

Times, 16 May 1995. p. 1M.

Comments: Inexperience combined with extremely
poor judgment. Caves are not the place for this sort of
horseplay. Cornwell had recently been discharged from the
service and had apparently kept the grenade as a souvenir.
Neil Crider was quoted as saying that he would like to go
caving again, but "probably not with Andy."


********** 6 June
Foglepole Cave, Illinois
flooding, near-entrapment
Steve Taylor, Jean Krejca, and Don Webb entered
Foglepole Cave to perform biological inventory work for the
US Fish and Wildlife Service. Before entering, they noted that
clouds appeared to be building. The forecast was for isolated
scattered showers across the region. They decided to stay
close to the entrance in case a storm started and to keep an eye
out for rising water.
The cave has two entrances located in a large
sinkhole with an in-flowing stream. Both entrances are gated,
but the cavers had the necessary permit and key. A small
trickle of water was flowing into the lower of the two
entrances. The cavers entered through the upper entrance and
went through several short low sections and one climb before
reaching the main trunk passage about 350 feet into the cave.
They began their collection work there, intending to remain
near the entrance and keep an eye on the water level.
After working for a while, Krejca heard what she
believed to be thunder and alerted the others. Moments later,
the sound of rushing water was heard by all three. Taylor
looked back toward the entrance and saw a muddy torrent of
flood water coming down the passage. In about three minutes
the stream bed changed from virtually dry to a 15-foot wide,
one-foot deep flood. The group quickly grabbed their
equipment and raced toward the entrance. The 15-foot long
and two-foot high entrance crawl, which had been dry earlier,
was now flowing with about six inches of water. They
scrambled through the crawl and out of the cave. The lower
entrance had become a nasty whirlpool in the bottom of the
sink. It was raining steadily, but not as hard as they had
expected to find.
When they walked back to their vehicle, they noted
downed trees and wind blown vegetation. They later found
that an extremely strong storm cell has passed directly over
the cave and that a tornado had moved through the area.
Apparently, the storm cell dumped a large quantity of rain in

---------- Page 41 ----------
the drainage area of the cave in a very short period, producing
a flash flood.
Steve Taylor, "A Unique Trip to Illinois' Sinkhole Plain",
Crawlway Courier, v29n1, Winter 1995, pp. 1-3.
Comments: Taylor notes that the group was aware of
the risk from rain, but did not expect such an intense storm.
Recent rains and flooding in the area may have left the ground
saturated and increased the probability of flash floods in the
cave. The cavers were well prepared with extra lights, extra
clothing, and food, but wisely decided to stay near the
entrance "just in case." Had the group gone further into the
cave, they might well have needed the extra supplies during
an entrapment. It is hard to believe just how quickly cave
streams can rise to hazardous levels unless you have
experienced the phenomenon.


********** 11 June
Ferris Pit, Tennessee
tree fell on ropes, near-miss
Jeff Bowers, John Morgan, Tom Loring, Zane Grey,
and Nelson Delk were visiting 251-foot deep Ferris Pit when a
strong thunderstorm swept over them. Bowers and Delk were
climbing on separate ropes when the storm hit. They were
soon soaked by the water falling down the shaft. Strong winds
and lightning racked the surface above. Suddenly, Bowers
heard a loud crashing sound and his rope was jerked upward.
Debris rained down the pit, covering the cavers with mud and
leaves. Bowers climbed quickly to the surface and found that
a large tree had fallen across his rope, barely missing the
rigging tree. Delk's rope was unaffected.
Bowers was unable to communicate with Delk over
the noise of the storm, and decided to retreat to a nearby barn
for shelter while Delk completed his climb. During a lull in
the storm he returned to the pit to check on Delk and was able
get a response to his calls. He then retreated to the barn as the
storm continued. When the storm abated, he ran back to the
pit and found Delk climbing over the lip. The cavers observed
seven trees down in the area around the pit.
Jeff Bowers, "Close Call at Ferris Pit", Speleotype, v16n3,
Fall 1996, pp. 52-53.
Comments: Bowers notes that Delk was the least
experienced member of the party, having done only one 80-
foot pit prior to the trip. Bowers had been accompanying him
on a second rope during the climb until the tree fell and he
decided to go on up to find out what had happened. This
unfortunately left Delk on rope by himself during the storm. It
is a good idea to send novice climbers up in the middle of the
party, SO that there are experienced people above and below
them if they get into trouble.
Climbing alongside the novice, as Bowers was doing,
is also helpful when there is room to do SO. In this case, the
storm altered the cavers' plans and Delk was left on his own.
Fortunately, he made it out without any problems.


********** 21 June
Bowden Cave, West Virginia,
lost
Four unidentified novice cavers entered Bowden
Cave. They made it through the first room and attempted to
find the main passage back into the deeper regions of the cave.
After searching for about 30 minutes, they returned to the first
room, but were unable to locate the passage leading to the
entrance. Anthony Clark and Eric Massa were present as part
of a Wilderness EMT hypothermia class being conducted in
the cave. They were able to lead the lost cavers back to the
surface.

********** 21 June
Rainbow Falls Cave, Colorado
stranded, hypothermia
A group of teenage explorers became stranded in this
small cave when they traversed a narrow ledge along the falls
and swam across a 12-foot deep pool but were unable to
reverse the procedure. The normally gentle creek was swollen
by heavy spring runoff from the surrounding mountains
combined with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. During the
ensuing rescue, a firefighter suffered a shoulder injury when
he slipped and fell while carrying a victim out of the water.
Richard Rhinehart, "Rescues Common at Rainbow Falls
Cave", Rocky Mountain Caving, v12n2, Spring 1995, p. 11.
Comments: The cave had become a popular
destination for local teenagers. The high water made the
traverse and swim treacherous. The cave was the scene of four
similar rescues in a five week period that spring, even though
area newspapers repeatedly warned of the danger.


********** 22 June
Bowden Cave, West Virginia
lost consciousness
During a National Cave Rescue Commission Eastern
Region mock rescue at Bowden Cave, two volunteer cavers
were being transported through the cave in a litter-bearing
exercise. The route was about 1,500 feet from the Water
Course to one of the entrances. After being transported about
300 feet one of the volunteer patients, a woman named Kim,
lost consciousness. The exercise was immediately halted and a
doctor was called to the scene. After about five minutes she
revived. She was removed from the stretcher and escorted
from the cave. The cause of her blackout was unknown.
Douglas Moore, Incident report, 21 September 1997.
Comments: Any time you are moving someone in a
stretcher or litter you must keep a close watch for breathing
problems, vomiting, or other difficulties. The person being
transported is usually unable to move or take action to
alleviate the problem without assistance. This is true even in a
practice session.

********** 30 June
Clarksville Cave, New York
lost, hypothermia
Three novice cavers from Schenectady arrived at the
cave, but one decided not to enter due to concern over heavy
rainfall. The other two, a man and a woman, went in through
the Gregory Entrance. They went through Brinleys Sump,
getting soaked in the process, and made it to the Slickenside
Room before becoming disoriented. When the pair failed to
emerge, their companion called for help. Two search teams
entered via the Ward Entrance, and the pair were soon found
along the Ward-Gregory connection route. The woman was
suffering from hypothermia. Both refused medical attention,
but were escorted from the cave.

********** 1 July
Eon Cave, California
rockfall entrapment
Bill Kenney (47), Roger Jones, and Tim Studebaker
entered Eon Cave in the Marble Mountains on a survey trip
during a Klamath Mountains Conservation Task Force field
expedition. The cave is about 300 feet long and is located in
an alpine environment reached by hiking several miles over
rough terrain. The cavers were working out of a base camp
established for the expedition.
As they finished the survey, Kenney climbed up out
of a small pit. He reached a ledge level with the main passage
and placed both hands on it to raise himself up. As he did so,
the ledge collapsed and a slab of rock six feet high, four feet
wide, and two feet thick fell and pinned his left leg against a
blade of rock on the left wall. His calf muscle was severely
compressed, causing him great pain. Once the group
determined that everything was stable and that they could not
move the rock, Studebaker was dispatched to summon help
from the nearby camp. During the wait, Jones used smaller
rocks to try to break the slab or the projection and free
Kenney, but was unsuccessful.
About an hour after the accident, Steve Knutson,
Bonnie Crystal, and Ruth Schwartz arrived from camp armed
with a pry bar and a radio. Knutson and Jones worked on the
slab with the pry bar, but could not move it. They called back
to camp on the radio and requested hammers and chisels,
which were quickly brought to the scene. Using a large
hammer, Knutson was able to break off the blade of rock that
Kenney's leg was pinned against, releasing him.
Kenney was unable to walk, but managed to crawl
and climb the 100 feet to the entrance with some assistance.
He had been trapped for about two hours. His leg was
examined and was found to have deep wounds on both sides
of the calf. He was in mild shock and suffering from muscle
spasms and severe pain. The wounds were bandaged and an
air splint was applied.
A Stokes litter had been brought up from a nearby
Forest Service guard station and Kenney was carried back
down to the camp, where his wounds were cleaned and
dressed. Arrangements were made by radio for a helicopter
evacuation the next morning. Kenny was placed near the fire
and made as comfortable as possible, with someone staying
awake to watch over him through the night. The next morning
he was carried up to the helicopter landing site and flown to
the hospital. There were no fractures, and the deep wounds
were closed with staples and sutures. He was given pain
medication and IV antibiotics and released.

Comments: Knutson notes that the incident was
handled very efficiently, but that they were fortunate that it
was in a shallow cave and not very far from camp. A similar
incident in one of the deeper, colder caves in the area would
be quite serious. Given the size of the slab, Kenney's injuries
were less severe than one might expect. The presence of
emergency equipment was important, as was the radio which
allowed them to arrange a quick evacuation. Knutson suggests
having more rock moving tools available in the future as well
as a SKED litter and a first response kit with hypothermia
supplies for in-cave use. He also suggests establishing a
formal emergency plan and communication arrangement with
the Forest Service and regional authorities to allow emergency
use of agency radio frequencies and rescue equipment.


********** 1 July
Nielsons Cave, Utah
rockfall, injury
Robert Cranney (22) was rappelling the 315-foot
entrance pit in Nielsons Cave when a large rock fell and
struck him on the head. His helmet absorbed and deflected the
blow, which knocked his two lights off of his helmet. Cranney
immediately tied off his rack and called out to his companions
that he had been hit and was bleeding. A caver on the bottom
got on rope and climbed up to him to assist. He arrived at
Cranney's position in about five minutes. Cranney felt at that
point that he would be able to climb out on his own. He
changed over to his ascending system and was able to climb
out in about ten minutes. Two of his fellow cavers escorted
him along the four mile hike back to the car and drove him to
a hospital where he was treated. He suffered a cut on his head
which required five stitches.
Robert Cranney, Accident report, undated.
Comments: Cranney notes that his helmet probably
saved his life. We agree, and further suggest that the quality of
a caving helmet makes a statement about the value the wearer
places on its contents. Cranney remained calm, changed to
ascent, and exited in good order.

********** 8 July
Fulford Cave, Colorado
caver fall, injury
While chimneying up to a ledge, Susan Gray (48)
slipped, kept her grip on a hold to stop her fall, and dislocated
her shoulder. Paul Burger was spotting her from below and
kept her from slipping back down a slope into the passage
below. Upon examination, the cavers felt that she would not
be able to exit without assistance, SO Randy Reck and Steve
Lester remained with Gray while Burger went for help. Lester
and Reck rigged a heat tent using garbage bags and a candle
and tried to keep Gray warm in the 35°F cave.
When rescuers arrived, the Incident Commander told
Burger to go back into the cave, reset the shoulder, and start
moving Gray toward the entrance. Though he was an
experienced caver with some rescue training, Burger was not
enthusiastic about this plan because he had no experience with
shoulder dislocations and because the injured person was his
mother. A paramedic showed him how to set and sling the arm
and gave him a bag of supplies, SO he decided to proceed.
Burger reentered the cave accompanied by the Chief
of the Volunteer Fire Department and the two made their way
back to Gray, flagging the route as they went in case others
had to follow. Following the paramedic's instructions, Burger
was able to reduce the dislocation, relieving most of Gray's
pain. Her arm was placed in a sling and the group helped her
out of the cave, belaying her on the climbs. Once outside the
cave, she was found to have also sprained her ankle in the fall.
Paul Burger, "The Rescue Review", Rocky Mountain Caving,
v12n2, Spring 1995, p. 7.
Comments: Reduction of a dislocated joint by an
untrained person is somewhat risky. It is possible to cause
significant injury if the procedure is not performed correctly.
It was not clear from the report why the paramedic or other
trained personnel did not enter the cave to perform the
procedure.
Burger notes that he missed the sprained ankle in his
initial examination, probably because the pain was masked by
the greater pain of the shoulder injury. He suggests checking
for additional injuries once the obvious ones have been
treated. It is important to be thorough in the initial
examination SO that appropriate treatment can be applied and
SO that rescuers, if summoned, can bring in the necessary
equipment and supplies.


********** 10 July
Rainbow Falls Cave, Colorado
stranded, hypothermia
This was the second of four similar rescues which
occurred at this cave in 1994. In this instance, the victims
were four youths ages 12 to 20 who were stranded at the
mouth of the cave after swimming across the pool to reach the
entrance. They were reportedly unable to make it back across
due to a strong undercurrent. The youths were treated for
hypothermia, as was one firefighter involved in the rescue.

********** 13 July
Superstitious Cave, Alaska
rockfall
Marcel LaPerriere and Shunichiro Go were to survey
in Superstitious Cave on Heceta Island. As LaPerriere was
digging in a stream passage which was formed down a
bedding plane, a slab of ceiling came down on his helmet,
which was about two inches below the ceiling. The slab was
about three to four feet long, 18 inches wide, and four inches
thick. The slab shoved him to the floor and broke upon
impact. LaPerriere's neck was sore for the afternoon.
Kevin Allred, "1994 and 1995 Tongass Cave Project
Expeditions Accident Report", undated.
Comments: LaPerriere points out that when digging
one should watch the ceiling. Allred notes that the material
disturbed in a dig can influence unstable material in the
surrounding area.


********** 16 July
Rainbow Falls Cave, Colorado
stranded, hypothermia
Third in the series of similar rescues at this cave, this
incident involved Jesse Bolling (15) and Jerad McCuster (15),
who became stranded on the ledge leading into the cave. Both
suffered mild hypothermia before being rescued.
Richard Rhinehart, "Rescues Common at Rainbow Falls
Cave", Rocky Mountain Caving, v12n2, Spring 1995, p. 11.


********** 18 July
Pittsford Ice Cave, Vermont
caver fall, injury
Two local youths entered the cave via a small
skylight entrance above the main room while a friend waited
on the surface. That entrance can be chimneyed for about 15
feet of its 45-foot depth but bells out below and requires a
rope to safely descend the drop. The boys were equipped with
a 3/8-inch polyethylene rope and one flashlight each. They
were wearing jeans and T-shirts and did not have helmets.
They reached the floor of the cave by descending hand-over-
hand and spent some time looking around before deciding to
climb out.
They attempted to climb the rope hand-over-hand,
both climbing at the same time. They had apparently reached
the bottom of the chimney when the lower of the two (age 14)
lost his grip and fell to the floor. There was a large buildup of
ice sloping away from the wall which redirected much of the
energy of the fall from vertical to horizontal. The youth
suffered a broken right leg and numerous minor bruises and
abrasions on his chest, arms, and hands. The youth who had
remained on the surface called for help. The other youth
descended to his injured companion and helped him to the
main entrance and out of the cave. Rescue personnel arrived

---------- Page 44 ----------
and carried him down the steep ravine to the road, where he
was taken to a hospital.
Kevin O'Classen, Incident report, 21 July 1995.
Comments: Inexperience, inadequate equipment,
poor judgment. The hand-over-hand vertical technique claims
another victim.


********** 21 July
Moon Probe Cave, Alaska
caver fall, injury
Aaron Gissburg was on a survey trip on the first day
of work in Moon Probe Cave on Dall Island. After descending
pits of 135, 90, and 60 feet, he was standing on a muddy slab
on the floor. The top of the slab was sloped and about 2.5 feet
above the ground. His feet slid out from under him and he fell
backwards. His left calf hit the edge of the slab and was badly
bruised. It was sore for about 10 days. He exited the cave
using a Texas system with the uninjured keg. The extreme
soreness did not become apparent until after his exit.
Kevin Allred, "1994 and 1995 Tongass Cave Project

********** 21 July
Rainbow Falls Cave, Colorado
stranded, hypothermia
Fourth in the series, this incident found a teenage boy
named Sam Rude stranded on the same ledge as the 16 July
incident. He was rescued and treated for hypothermia.

Cave", Rocky Mountain Caving, v12n2, Spring 1995, p. 11.


********** 23 July
Moon Probe Cave, Alaska
caver fall, lost consciousness
Shunichiro Go (Japanese) and Sergay Levachev
(Russian) were exploring and surveying at the furthest point
of previous exploration in Moon Probe Cave on Dall Island
during the Ketchicave Expedition. Shunichiro did not speak
Russian and Levachev did not speak Japanese, SO the two
were using English to communicate. Neither was fluent in the
language. Shunichiro was on rope cleaning rocks at the
entrance of one pit while Levachev was trying to figure out
how to rig a second pitch about 15 to 20 feet away. Levachev
slipped and fell six feet or more, landing in a small depression
in the floor. When Shunichiro returned he found Levachev
unconscious. When Levachev regained consciousness, they
determined that he had been out for three to five minutes.
Levachev exited the cave under his own power and was
examined by an EMT at camp. He exhibited no injuries other
than a bruised leg.
Kevin Allred, "1994 and 1995 Tongass Cave Project
Expeditions Accident Report", undated.
Comments: Allred notes that it was a good idea to
exit the cave immediately, especially considering its remote
location. Any time a caver is knocked unconscious it is time to
leave and seek medical attention. Head injuries can be quite
serious, and may not display immediate problems. Symptoms
that may manifest following injury include: drowsiness,
nausea, vomiting, and unequal or unresponsive pupils.


********** 8 August
Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico
caver fall, injury, stranded on rope
Brad Christian, an experienced rock climber, was
climbing over some breakdown when he slipped and fell a
short distance, striking his torso on the rock resulting in
broken ribs. He was able to make the trip back to Boulder
Falls, but became exhausted while climbing out and was
unable to continue. He was about 60 feet up the rope in the
150-foot pit.
A second rope (kept at the top in case of
emergencies) was lowered, and Art Fortini climbed up beside
Christian to assist. Fortini executed a pick-off maneuver and
lowered Christian to the floor with his rappel rack. A doctor
was present and examined Christian, diagnosing broken ribs
with no signs of lung involvement. She indicated that it would
be safe to haul him up the pit as long as he avoided exertion or
heavy breathing, which might result in a punctured lung.
Fortini left the cave to inform the Park Service and
bring back hauling equipment and assistance for the operation.
Cavers and Park Service personnel returned with
Fortini and a 3:1 haul system was set up. They decided to
package Christian in a SKED litter and haul him in a vertical
orientation to minimize the danger to Christian from the
rockfall which gives the pit its name. The haul was executed
without difficulty as Fortini climbed the rope alongside
Christian.
At the top, Christian was removed from the litter and
was able to make his way to the bottom of the entrance pit.
There he was re-packaged in the SKED and hauled out. He
was able to walk back to the car, and elected not to go to the
hospital.

v8n3, Fall 1995.
2. Art Fortini, "Lech Accident", Cavers Digest #5201, 14
August 1995.
Comments: Christian was climbing using the two-
ascender Yosemite system, which is similar to a Mitchell
system but not as efficient, requiring more upper body
strength. It also uses a chest harness, which placed pressure on
the injured ribs.
The pick-off is a maneuver which allows a single
rescuer to lower a stranded climber down the pit while on rope
with or beside the climber. It is a very handy technique to
know, and was used effectively to remove Christian from a
dangerous situation. Fortini notes that bolts placed at Boulder
Falls as a result of Emily Mobley's rescue made the haul
system safer and easier to arrange. The rescue ran smoothly
and quietly, with minimal media attention. Christian was out

of the cave about 17 hours after becoming stranded at Boulder
Falls.

********** 3 September
Bigfoot Cave, California
near misses on rappel, inexperience
Seven cavers entered Bigfoot Cave via the Discovery
Entrance. The cave begins with a 75-foot entrance pit. At the
bottom is a ledge leading to a second drop into the remainder
of the cave. The first person down was a novice caver. For
unknown reasons, he decided to get off rope on a narrow
ledge halfway down the drop. A fall from this point would
have been more than 100 feet in length. The second caver
down found him on the ledge, clinging to a crack in the wall.
He told the first caver to wait until he was clear and get back
on rope to complete the descent. The first caver did this and
soon was on the correct ledge at the bottom.
Other cavers descended and the group prepared to
descend the second drop. A traverse line was rigged along the
ledge and out to the rig point to allow cavers to remain clipped
in while getting on rope. The novice caver approached the rig
point to descend, but did not clip in to either the safety line or
the main line. Another caver pointed this out and the novice
caver replied that his safety ascender was in his pack. The
novice caver began to rig his rappel rack, but became nervous
and confused after putting on four bars. He took his rack off
of the rope and moved away from the drop. Then, suddenly,
he changed his mind and lunged for the rope. He pulled it
back from the lip and started to rig his rack, placing three bars
on the rope. As he moved toward the edge to rappel, one of
the cavers stopped him and told him that if he went over on
three bars he would not be able to stop and would fall to the
bottom.
The novice caver became agitated and hostile. He
took his rack off rope and began yelling at the other caver,
announcing that he was leaving the cave. The other cavers
continued down the drop, and the novice caver changed his
mind and continued, this time using his safety ascender while
getting on rope. Later the group split into two parties, and the
novice caver left with the first group out.
Steve J. Davis, Incident report, 11 September 1995.
Comments: Novice cavers should not be sent down
first, especially when they do not know the route. The novice
caver may have thought that he was getting off onto the
correct ledge. Someone more experienced or more familiar
with the cave should have gone first. A safety ascender kept in
the pack is useless and offers no added safety. It should be on
the harness where it can be easily reached and used.
Rappelling on four bars is inadvisable. Rappelling on
three is suicidal. It is usually a good idea to clip in with a
safety ascender while preparing to rappel, especially when
other cavers are on the bottom. There is always a possibility
that someone may move or pull on the rope while you are
rigging your rappel device, yanking you into the pit. It is also
a good idea to clip in to a rope or safety line while standing or
moving on an exposed ledge at the top of a drop. Judging by
the emotional outburst, the novice caver was having some
difficulty and feeling stressed. He probably should have been
escorted out at that point, if not sooner.


********** 3 September
Owl Cave, Virginia
stuck
Three cavers entered Owl Cave on Sunday morning,
intending to explore the 3,000-foot cave and exit by the "back
door," a small entrance on the other side of the ridge about 15
minutes from the main entrance. Two of the cavers were
familiar with the cave and exited without difficulty. One
remarked that the entrance was smaller and tighter than he had
remembered. The third caver (33) attempted to exit and
became stuck, right at the entrance, with his head and
shoulders outside the cave.
The owner of the cave, Phil Lucas, was nearby with
several other cavers who were camping on the property for the
Labor Day weekend. They were within earshot of the entrance
and responded to a call for help. Initially, the stuck caver
thought that he just needed a couple of people to help pull him
out. The sinuous passage made it difficult for him to push with
his legs. Initial efforts at pulling, however, caused him
considerable pain. A caver went back around through the
main entrance to get behind him and try to help him back into
the cave. Unfortunately, the caver had pushed forward as far
as he could and was now unable to move in either direction.
The passage in which the caver was stuck occurs
between several desk-size breakdown blocks which would
have been difficult to move. The rescuers used a battery
powered drill to make a row of holes along the edge of the
rock and then hammered stonemason's wedges and shims into
the holes to break out a section of rock. The process was
repeated several times, removing rock in a gentle and
controlled fashion, until the trapped caver was able to slide
back into the cave. The process took several hours, and the
small crowd of cavers who had gathered to watch raised an
uproar at that point, insisting that the rescuers had gotten it all
wrong by putting him back into the cave instead of getting
him out. A few blows from a sledge quickly removed the
remaining protrusions and allowed the caver to exit, four
hours after he had become stuck.
Bill Royster, Incident report, undated.
Comments: Lucas notes that the wedges and shims
are very useful in situations where rescuers have limited
working room. They do not require much effort to use and can
be used in close proximity to a patient without imposing

---------- Page 46 ----------
undue risk. The shims and wedges are available in various
sizes. A portable rock drill is required to make the holes.
When confronted with a tight spot, it is generally a good idea
not to advance beyond your ability to retreat.


********** 9 September
Blowing Sink Cave, Texas
rockfall, injury
A group of six experienced cavers were exploring the
lowest level of the cave where they encountered large unstable
breakdown. Five of the cavers entered a very low crawl.
Lloyd Morrison was about to enter when some of the others
turned around and started out. One of them grabbed a boulder
which was balanced precariously over the entrance to the
crawl and found it to be loose. The five in the crawl did not
want to risk crawling under the loose boulder.
Morrison climbed to an upper level where a digging
project had been in progress and returned with some boards
which he used to brace the boulder. This constricted the crawl
opening and only one of the cavers was able to fit through.
Morrison again climbed to the upper level and returned with a
hammer which he used to enlarge the opening until the four
cavers were able to exit.
Morrison then decided to remove the hazard
presented by the boulder. When he knocked out the bracing
boards, the boulder immediately fell and blocked the crawl.
Morrison attempted to push it out of the way. As he was
pushing, the rock rolled suddenly to one side and caught
Morrison's left hand between a sharp edge of the boulder and
the wall. Morrison's little finger was severed just below the
base of the nail. The end of the finger was attached only by a
flap of skin and the bone was visibly shattered and protruding.
The ring finger was also lacerated.
Morrison borrowed a glove from another caver to
protect his hand, and exited the cave in about two hours. He
went to the emergency room at a nearby hospital where a hand
surgeon was called in to reattach the finger. The ring finger
also required stitches. The reattachment was successful and
the fingers made a complete recovery.
Lloyd Morrison, Incident report, 25 March 1996.
Comments: Use caution when dealing with unstable
breakdown. It might have been better not to have entered the
crawl, or to have left well enough alone once the cavers were
out.


********** 9 September
Hughes Cave, Alabama
caver fall, injury
Tommy Young (30) was exploring with two friends
when he slipped and fell while climbing up a 20-foot pit. The
men were caving with hand-held flashlights and did not have
helmets. Young fell onto a pile of boulders, landing on his
right side, and suffered internal and spinal injuries. He was
about 2,000 feet into the cave when the accident occurred.
Two of his companions remained with him while
another left the cave to summon help. The Huntsville cave
rescue team was called, and Young was brought out of the
cave in a seven hour operation. He was airlifted to a nearby
hospital and admitted in stable condition.
1. Christopher Bell, "Rescuers free Arab man from cave after
7 hours", Huntsville Times, 10 September 1995, p. A24.
2. Wes Coleman, Incident report, undated.
Comments: Inexperience, inadequate equipment,
exceeding abilities. A 20-foot climb should probably be
belayed, especially when the consequences of a fall are
severe. The men should have been wearing helmets and
helmet-mounted lights.


********** 24 September
Lundays Roadside Cave, Florida
bad air
John Martello (30) and Daniel Sloan (27) entered the
cave intending to search for new cave in the Drain Passage
beyond the Ordeal Squeeze. As he passed through the
squeeze, Martello noticed that his breathing had become rapid
and shallow and that he was sweating abnormally. He
retreated from the passage and the two moved to another part
of the cave.
Martello's breathing recovered somewhat, but he
began to have difficulty again at the Flat Pass. In the Colossus
Room they sat down to rest. By this time Sloan was also
experiencing difficulty. The cavers became suspicious of the
air quality and decided to leave immediately. As they neared
the entrance and felt air flowing in their breathing returned to
normal.
John Martello, Incident report, undated.
Comments: Martello notes that they had made
previous trips to the cave without incident, but that the lower
levels had been altered recently due to sand and silt movement
by flooding. A cave entrance across the street had also been
sealed recently, possibly affecting airflow in the cave. Cavers
should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of bad air,
and should exit immediately when bad air is suspected.
September
Scott Hollow Cave, West Virginia
lost
A group of local youths entered the cave without
permission and became lost. They were reportedly rescued by
the owner, who is a caver and NSS member.

********** 14 October
Gage Cave, New York
lost, trapped by water
Five Rensselaer Outing Club members entered Gage
Cave about 6:00 p.m. intending to explore the Lost Passage.
All had full wetsuits and packs with two backup lights, food,
and water. They passed easily through the low airspace and

---------- Page 47 ----------
reached the Battle Room at about 8:00 p.m. The group
decided that, for the return trip, they would enter the water
one at a time, yell at the low air space and then proceed
through. Each person would then go down the passage trying
not to make waves, and wait for the previous person to clear
the low air space before proceeding. They hoped to avoid
bunching up in cold water waiting to pass through the low air
space.
Sarah Cutler was the coldest SO she went first. As
planned, at the low air space, she yelled back. Scott Stepenuck
was next. He also yelled at the low air space and Joe Baj
followed. Baj yelled and was followed by Thomas Howell and
then Eric Kirchner. At the low air space Kirchner encountered
Howell who said that Cutler and Stepenuck had gone down a
side passage which appeared to sump. Stepenuck's yell had
apparently been an attempt to report that Cutler was missing.
Howell and Kirchner both tried the passage and found
insufficent air to continue. They returned to the Square Room
hoping Cutler and Stepenuck had gone on ahead.
Cutler had in fact not followed the S turn all the way
and had gone straight, taking the wrong passage. She ducked
through two small sumps and came up into a room which she
thought would be the Square Room. When Cutler realized she
was not where she should be, she called out to the others but
received no response. She tried to retrace her route, but could
not get back through the sumps. She returned to the small
room and this time was able to make voice contact with
Stepenuck, who had gone through the correct passage and was
in the Square Room. They established that she was in a
passage below the Square Room, but that the access was
blocked by breakdown.
Kirchner and Howell returned to the Square Room,
where Stepenuck reported that Cutler was in the chamber
below. Hoping to help her find the way out, Howell went back
through the low airspace and around to Cutler. Once there, he
too felt that it was not possible to go back through the sumps.
Both cavers were now stranded. Cutler was out of the water
on a ledge, and was eating some food from her pack. Howell
joined her on the ledge.
Realizing that Howell and Cutler were not in the


********** water, Kirchner and Stepenuck saw two options: dig them out
or use scuba gear. Either option would require assistance.
Stepenuck and Baj went for help while Kirchner remained in
the cave to provide support. Kirchner began to dig with what
few tools he had and managed to create a triangular opening
about 15 inches on each side. Cutler could not quite fit
through.
Stepenuck and Baj went to the nearby home of Emily
Mobley to call for help. When they were unable to rouse
Mobley, they called the Sheriff. Mobley was awakened by the
time an ambulance arrived, and proceeded to the cave with
heat packs, extra clothing, and food. She entered and
proceeded to the Square Room, which is not far from the
entrance. The heat packs and food were given to the trapped
cavers.
Thinking that others were following her and would
soon arrive to help, Mobley stayed in the Square Room to help
Kirchner dig. After removing one or two big blocks, Kirchner
and Mobley were able to pull Cutler and Howell from the
chamber. Cutler and Howell exited under their own power
with some assistance at climbs from rescuers arriving at the
cave. They were taken to a nearby hospital and treated for
hypothermia.

The Daily Editor, Cobbleskill, NY, 16 October 1995,
Comments: The cavers went through the low-
airspace separately to minimize waves. Cutler thought that she
was in the correct passage but that the water had risen, until
she reached the breakdown room and realized her mistake.
She was then unable to get back through the two near-siphons
that she had passed through on the way in. Howell hurried
after Cutler because he was concerned that she was in trouble.
As a result, he became stranded with her. If someone more
familiar with the route had gone through the low-airspace
first, the incident might have been avoided.
Kirchner notes that the initial rescuers brought in no
digging tools, even though Stepenuck and Baj had asked for
digging help. Porter reports that rescuers on the surface were
expecting Mobley to come back out and report, and did not
know what to send into the cave. Mobley indicates that she
thought they would be coming in behind her, and therefore did
not need to go out to report. In a more serious incident these
small miscues could compound the situation. In this case they
did not affect the outcome, but do serve to illustrate some
important points for rescuers to consider.
It is important not to make a situation worse by
getting additional cavers or rescuers stranded with the victim.
It is also important to communicate with the surface during a
rescue operation, especialy in the early stages. Written
communication is preferable over oral messages. A pencil and
paper are useful for first responders. Fortunately in this case,
Mobley and Kirchner were able to free the trapped pair
without too much difficulty. Everyone remained calm, and the
incident was quickly resolved.


********** 21 October
Hancock Cave, Virginia
trapped by rockfall
Darrin Smith (29) was in a group of seven
experienced cavers who were exploring Hancock Cave. They
were in a large trunk passage which appeared to end at a
crawlway. Two cavers crawled through, but Smith decided to
climb over the obstruction. As he began to climb, a section of
wall and ledge broke loose, and two ten-foot square by seven
to ten-inch thick slabs fell on him. He was knocked to the
ground and his legs were pinned beneath the slabs.
The other cavers were able to move the 300-pound
slabs and free Smith, who was found to have sustained only
scrapes and bruises. The soft earth apparently cushioned the
blow, and the flat shape of the slabs may have distributed the

---------- Page 48 ----------
weight evenly, preventing more severe injury. Smith was able
to exit with assistance from his companions.

Comments: Smith was very lucky not to have been
seriously injured. Loose rock comes in all shapes and sizes.
Cavers must be suspicious of every ledge and hold. In spite of
this, some incidents may be impossible to avoid. Loose rock is
one of the fundamental hazards of caving.


********** 1 November
Clarksville Cave, New York
lost
Four cavers from Hartwick College entered the cave,
explored the Ward section and visited the Gregory end. In the
process they waded through the Bathtub and became chilled.
As the group was exiting the cave, some confusion developed
regarding the route. At a junction about 100 feet in from the
entrance there was a disagreement on how to proceed. Two of
the party insisted on going through a low crawl, while the
other two insisted on taking the larger passage. The first two
took the crawl and exited the cave. Rather than go back
through the crawl and retrieve their companions, they called
for help. Thom Engel and Emily Mobley responded, along
with local emergency services. The two missing cavers were
quickly found in the Root Room and led out. Each had one
functioning flashlight.

********** 18 November
Natural Well, Alabama
stranded in pit, inadequate equipment
Two men attempted to explore Natural Well sharing
a single set of vertical gear, which they used in turn to
descend the 180-foot deep shaft. The first man climbed out
and dropped the equipment down for the man on bottom.
Unfortunately, it landed on a ledge 50 feet above the floor,
leaving the man stranded. The Huntsville Cave Rescue Unit
pulled him out.
"Spelunker rescued from well", Huntsville Times, 19
November 1995, p. B5.
Comments: It is very poor form to share vertical
equipment in a cave. Each caver should have his own
complete rig. It is also very poor form to drop or toss gear
down a pit. In addition to being dangerous for cavers at the
bottom, it can damage the equipment, sometimes in subtle
ways, making it unsafe for use. And, of course, it can leave
you stranded.


********** 23 November
Sotano del Pozo, San Luis Potosi, Mexico
rockfall, injury
Paul Aughey (28), Alan Cressler, Chris Hudson, and
Jim Hewett visited Sotano del Pozo during a caving trip to
Mexico. The cave begins with a 60-foot entrance drop down a
steep, vegetated slope strewn with loose rocks. At the bottom
there is a 376-foot pit, which also has loose rock around the
top. They descended the first pit and rigged the second,
placing rope pads and clearing debris from the lip. Cressler
descended, clearing more loose rock as he went. He was
followed by Hewett and Aughey
When he reached the bottom, Aughey found Cressler
and Hewett crouching in a fissure 70 feet from the rope in
order to avoid the rockfall zone. Cressler and Hewett climbed
out, and Hudson descended. Aughey then began his climb.
When he reached a point five feet below the lip, the rope
popped out of a crevice and dislodged a football-sized rock. It
fell and stuck Aughey on the front of his helmet, breaking his
light.
He caught the rock with his right arm and held it
while he turned on his backup light. He then looked for a safe
place to put the rock. Finding none, he yelled "Rock!", waited
for Hudson to take cover, and dropped the rock down the pit.
Aughey received a cut on the bridge of his nose, a small cut
below his left eye, and a black eye.
Paul Aughey, Incident report, 5 February 1996.
Comments: Aughey notes that the cavers cleared as
much loose rock as they could before descending, rigged
carefully, and climbed carefully to avoid causing rockfall.
They also took care to stay out of the rockfall zone while on
the bottom. In spite of these precautions, an injury occurred.
Always be alert for rockfall around pits. It is sometimes
unavoidable. Aughey's helmet prevented more serious injury.
His helmet-mounted backup light allowed him to see after his
main light was broken by the rock.


********** 25 November
Laurel Caverns, Pennsylvania
caver fall, injury
Long-time caver Dale Ibberson was injured during a
survey trip in Laurel Caverns when what he took to be a one
foot step down turned out to be about three feet. He was
reeling out tape to set a station when he fell and struck a rock
with his hip, fracturing his pelvis. He was unable to stand.
Laurel Caverns is a commercial cave, and a party of
tourists happened by shortly after the accident. They stayed
with Ibberson while his companion, Jay Reich, went for help.
A caver-employee of Laurel Caverns called in local cavers to
assist. Within an hour of the accident, Ibberson was packaged
and on his way out in a litter.
During the evacuation, a large group of fire and
rescue personnel arrived, accompanied by reporters. No one
was sure who had called them. They "blew past" the caver
handling entrance control and entered without helmets and

lights. After some initial confusion, the evacuation proceeded
without difficulty.
Keith Conover, Incident report and analysis, undated.
Comments: This incident was handled well by the
rescuers involved, but demonstrates the importance of
establishing a good working relationship with local fire and
rescue agencies before an accident occurs. There were various
miscues during the evacuation attributable to inexperienced
and untrained rescuers among the cavers and fire department
members. Joint training exercises between cavers and local
rescue groups can be valuable. Even with that kind of practice
and preplanning, things can go awry when people get excited.


********** 2 December
Jewell Cave, South Dakota
caver fall, injury
Marc Ohms, Mike Wiles, Kelly Mathis, and Keen
Butterworth were on a survey trip in a recently-discovered
section of Jewel Cave. While mapping, the party had to
descend a smooth 10-foot slope. Holding the survey tape in
one hand, Mathis tried to chimney down. He slipped and fell
about six feet. His right leg struck a sharp piece of breakdown
causing a 6-inch long gash on his shin which left the bone
exposed for two to three inches. They did not have a first aid
kit, but improvised a bandage using a clean shirt and duct
tape.
On the way out of the cave, they passed one of the
in-cave first aid caches. The improvised bandage was holding
up well, SO they decided not to disturb the wound by changing
the dressing. They took extra gauze pads and some pain
medication from the kit and continued the 3.5 hour journey to
the surface. Mathis was driven to the hospital, where he
received treatment including 30 stitches and a course of
intravenous antibiotics to prevent bone infection.

2. Marc Ohms, Incident report, 31 January 1997.
Comments: Wiles and Ohms note that Mathis could
have attached the tape to his pack or lowered it to free his
hands for the climb. They also note that it would have been
helpful to have a small first aid kit with the party instead of
relying on the in-cave rescue caches, the nearest of which was
over one hour's travel from the accident site.


********** 26 December
Easter Cave, Vermont
trapped by rockfall
While digging in newly-discovered Easter Cave, Bob
and Tom Dion were pulling rocks out of the ceiling as they
tried to get into an upper passage. Tom cleared an opening
into the void above and stood up, placing his head and
shoulders into the passage. He felt something brush the back
of his head. Thinking that he had dislodged some small rocks,
he ducked back down. Heavy breakdown slid into the
opening, pinning his arm above him. He yelled for Bob, who
reached him in a few seconds. They managed to free Tom's
arm and moved away from the hole to recover. Suddenly a
large avalanche of rock fell, sealing the opening.

unnamed cave in Hart County, Kentucky
stranded, exhaustion, inadequate equipment
A stranded caver was rescued from a pit after

Winter
Pig Hole, Virginia
stranded during pull-down
A group of cavers visiting Pig Hole planned to rappel
into the upper entrance, pull the rope down, tour the cave, and
exit by the lower horizontal entrance. They neglected to check
the lower entrance beforehand, and were unaware that it was
choked with debris. They were unable to remove the
obstruction from inside the cave, and were stranded.
About three or four hours after the first group
entered, a group of cavers from the VPI Grotto entered the
cave. They had checked the lower entrance, but were not
planning a through trip. They encountered the first group in
the cave and made their rope available to the stranded cavers,
who exited without further incident.
Report from NCRC Eastern Region web site, undated.
Comments: When contemplating a pull-down
through-trip, be sure the lower entrance is open and that you
know how to find it.

February
unspecified Caribbean island cave
lost, stranded snorkeling in cave
While on a Caribbean island vacation, David Parks
and his friend Gerry (last name unknown) heard from locals
about a deep cave with a large pool. They decided to go
exploring, and climbed down a 70-foot vertical shaft into the
cave carrying snorkeling gear and diving lights. They found
the pool, put on their gear, and proceeded to explore. At the
far end of the pool they found a passage. They proceeded
down the passage deeper into the cave, swimming from one
air pocket to another. Eventually they surfaced in another
large room. After sitting there for a few minutes they decided
to exit the cave.
Parks led the way, but became disoriented and ended
up heading off in a different direction from Gerry. The silt
from the bottom clouded his view and added to his confusion.
As his lungs began to burn, he realized that he was swimming
deeper into the cave
Fortunately, Parks discovered an air pocket just in
time. He was SO desperate for air that he hit his head on the
stalactites that hung from the low ceiling. He climbed up on a
small shelf to rest and collect his thoughts. He was very
worried that he might not be able to get out.
After a while, he put his mask back on and stuck his
head into the water. Turning off his flashlight, he looked for
any trace of light from Gerry or from the entrance. Gerry had
exited safely, and was waiting at the other end of the tunnel.
When Parks did not appear, he became concerned and began
calling and shining his dive light back into the tunnel. Parks
saw a hint of light in the milky water. Taking a deep breath he
swam toward the light, surfacing next to his companion.
David Parks and Jennifer Rinne, "Snorkeler Lost and
Trapped in an Underground Cave", Skin Diver, v43n4, April
1994, p. 182.
Comments: Inexperience, inadequate equipment,
poor judgment. Parks writes that they did not realize how
lucky they had been until they talked about the experience
with some scuba divers afterward. Air pockets do not always
contain breathable air, and the thick silt can take days to settle
and clear the water.


********** 27 March
Sotano de San Augustin, Mexico
lost consciousness during dive
Ian Rolland (29) was a member of a multi-national
expedition to the Huautla Cave System, Sotano de San
Augustin, Oaxaca, Mexico. The object of this project was to
pass an underwater tunnel known as the San Augustin sump at
the bottom of the system and push on to greater depths. The
divers used an experimental closed-circuit rebreather
apparatus (Cis-Lunar MK4) developed for the project by Bill
Stone. All divers had received training in the operation and
use of the apparatus.
In a series of seven dives during the first three weeks
of the expedition, Noel Sloan, Steve Porter, and Ian Rolland
penetrated about 750 feet into the sump at depths up to 80
feet. Water temperature was 64 degrees Fahrenheit and
visibility was five to ten feet. There were no problems with
the diving apparatus other than the discovery that the useful
life of the lithium hydroxide canisters used for carbon dioxide
removal was found to be about six hours rather than the
expected seven to eight hours. This was attributed to colder
water and more frequent use of the canisters than in the
training dives.
On March 26, Rolland and Kenny Broad arrived at
Camp 5 (the sump) to continue the exploration. In three dives
on the 26th and 27th, they traversed approximately 1,400 feet
of passage and broke out into a large air filled tunnel 60 feet
wide and 40 feet tall. They decided that Rolland would make
one more dive to push on from the chamber before they would
return to Camp 3 with news of the discovery.
Rolland left Camp 5 at 4:00 p.m. on the 27th,
anticipating a four hour tip. At 10:00 p.m. when he had not
returned, Broad suited up and ascended to Camp 3 to organize
a rescue party in accordance with a pre-existing plan.
At 5:00am on March 28, a team consisting of Bill
Stone, Jim Brown, Rick Stanton, Paul Whybro, and Kenny
Broad descended to the sump. A second rebreather unit was
assembled and tested, and Broad prepared to dive. At 12:15
p.m. Broad entered the water and at 12:45 p.m. he reached the
air-filled chamber. He noted footprints leading out of the
water, across a sand bar, and back into the water. He swam
around the sand bar and continued for about 50 feet along the
surface until he spotted Rolland lying on his right side on the
bottom in nine feet of water, with open surface above.
There was no sediment in the water, nor was there
any silt on the body. The bottom was smooth and undisturbed.
Rolland's mouthpiece was out and there was no sign of a
struggle. The rebreather computer display indicated full tanks
and a partial pressure of oxygen of 0.17. It appeared that
Rolland began a second dive after traversing the first sump
and sandbar, and that he passed out, sank, and drowned after
spending some time tying lines near the surface. The direction
of his dive line and the location of his body suggested that he
was returning to the sandbar when he passed out. The
rebreather computer depth sensor recorded a descent from the
surface to nine feet at 4:57 p.m.
The following morning, March 29, at 8:37 a.m. Stone
returned to the chamber and began a two hour investigation.
Rolland's mouthpiece was in the closed circuit (rebreather)
position. The oxygen cutoff valve on his rebreather was in the
closed (off) position. Some of the divers, including Rolland,
often turned off the valve when surfacing to conserve oxygen.
By 11:30 a.m. Stone returned to Camp 5 with Rolland and the
rebreather. The rebreather was tested and found to be
functioning properly once the oxygen cutoff valve was

---------- Page 51 ----------
opened. It was subsequently used by another diver during the
expedition without incident.
The body recovery took six days. An autopsy was
performed one week after the accident and the cause of death
was determined to be "asphyxia due to immersion in water." It
was not listed as "drowning" because there was no water in
the lungs.
1. Bill Stone, "Accident Analysis", Underwater Speleology,
v22n1, January/February 1995, pp. 15-25.
2. Don Broussard, Personal communications, November
1995.
Comments: Rolland's location and position suggest
that he re-entered the water to begin his second dive, began
tying line, then started back to the sand bar, possibly in
response to some sort of problem. On the way, he lost
consciousness, lost his mouthpiece, sank to the bottom, and
died. The reason for the loss of consciousness is unknown.
The rebreather computer contained a data log for the
fatal dive. Information from the log was later downloaded, but
in the process some data from the first few minutes of the dive
were apparently lost. It was therefore not possible to
determine exactly what happened prior to 4:57 p.m. when the
computer recorded Rolland's descent to the floor of the
passage. The rebreather system appeared to have functioned
as designed.
The failure to re-open the oxygen cutoff valve was
significant, but Stone argues in his analysis that this would not
have resulted in hypoxia during the first few minutes of the
dive, when the system was pre-charged with oxygen. Log data
indicating an oxygen partial pressure of 0.24 at 4:57 p.m.
would appear to support this. Without the missing log data it
is impossible to determine whether Rolland breathed an
hypoxic gas mixture during the first few minutes of his dive.
In addition to the rebreather, Rolland carried a "bailout tank"
of air for emergencies. It was not used. It also appears that he
was swimming at or near the surface when he became
unconscious.
Rolland was an insulin-dependent diabetic, and there
was some speculation that an insulin imbalance might have
contributed to the accident. The lack of evidence of struggle
or convulsions, the presence of Rolland's unopened energy
bars in his pouch, the fact that he was strong enough to walk
out of the water and across the sand bar wearing 160 pounds
of equipment, and the absence of water in his lungs do not
appear to support this scenario.


********** 6 April
Zacaton, Mexico
lost consciousness during deep dive
Sheck Exley (45) and Jim Bowden (52) entered
Zacaton, a 1,025-foot deep cenote in Tamaulipas, on an
attempt to set a world record for deep diving on scuba
equipment. They had pre-placed two dive lines about 30 feet
apart as well as additional air tanks for the lengthy
decompression. Their plan was to descend quickly along the
guide lines to the bottom at -1,025 feet and then start
immediately for the surface. The water was murky, and
Bowden lost sight of Exley about 850 feet below the surface.
Bowden developed a problem with his equipment
and stopped his descent after 11 minutes at -925 feet. He
began the nine-hour ascent to the surface. Observers on the
surface noted that the stream of bubbles from Exley's tank
stopped about 18 minutes into the dive. As he ascended and
light from the surface improved visibility, Bowden discovered
that Exley's decompression tanks on the adjacent line were
untouched. The next day Exley's body was recovered. It was
wrapped in the guide line at a depth of 906 feet.

Comments: Sheck Exley was widely known as an
expert on cave diving and deep diving with scuba equipment.
He was a diving instructor and had written extensively on
diving and cave diving safety and techniques. He was the
holder of the previous depth record (881 feet). It is thought
that he blacked out during descent. He had reportedly
experienced some difficulty with high pressure nervous
syndrome on the earlier dive to 881 feet in South Africa.
Diving at these depths is extremely hazardous.

Lake Apopka Cavern, Florida
out of air, inadequate equipment
The bodies of Kevin Gokey (26) and Daniel Smith
(30) were found in 96 feet of water after they drowned while
scuba diving in the cave. The divers were not using a guide
line and had only two small lights each. They apparently
became disoriented when they stirred up the silt and lost
visibility, then ran out of air before they could find their way
out. They had arrived at the cave by boat with several
companions, and entered the cave with tanks holding about 45
minutes of air. When they did not return in an hour, their
companions called authorities. They were not trained or
certified in cave diving.

a spare regulator and shared a tank with him as they swam
back up to 250 feet at the 1,200 foot penetration point. Both
divers then switched to regular air, and they continued out
using their propulsion units.
Choudri reported that they had traveled about 300
feet and ascended to a depth of 200 feet when Suarez "blew
by me" and crashed into the ceiling of the passage. When he
reached Suarez he found him dead. Running low on air, he left
Suarez and completed his ascent. Suarez was reported to be a
master diver and a PADI certified instructor. He had dived at
the mine many times.

2. Eugene Meyer, "Experienced Scuba Diver Dies Doing
What He Lived to Do", The Washington Post, 20 July

Comments: Hires notes that Suarez was not
following the "rule of thirds" commonly used for air
management in diving. His double tanks were empty and he
was attempting to switch to what should have been an
emergency reserve.
Suarez had a reputation for not following prescribed
air management rules, and had reportedly been banned from
several dive boats. One of the recovery divers was a friend of
Suarez who had been involved in three previous out-of-air
situations in which he had to give Suarez air during a dive. On
a previous dive at this site, Suarez had experienced a deep
water blackout at 210 feet while switching from bottom mix
(trimix) to air. He was out for ten seconds with his buddy
holding his regulator in his mouth until he came around.
The trigger of the propulsion unit was stuck in the on
position. It is possible that Suarez became light-headed from
the gas switch and became unable to control the propulsion
unit, which then pulled him too high too fast resulting in
embolism. The regulator failure may have been the first link in
a chain of circumstances which resulted in the fatality.

incorrect gas mixture
Robert McGuirre and Dell Moats were conducting a

were marked as to the mix. McGuirre mistakenly took the
50/50 mix to 140 feet depth instead of the lesser nitrox, which
he left at 70 feet. On the way out, McGuirre began convulsing
during decompression. Moats was unable to save McGuirre,
who drowned. There were no other divers present in the cave
or on the surface for support. McGuirre was reported to have
taken several Sudafed tablets shortly before the dive.
George Irvine, Incident report, 16 July 1995, posted on the
Cave Divers Email List and quoted on the Cave Diving
Accidents web site at http://grove.ufl.edu/~ken/cave-
accidents.html, maintained by Ken Sallot.
Comment: This fatality resulted from something that
could become more common in the future as and more cave
divers take up mixed gas to explore to greater depths. The
50/50 mix 50% oxygen is considered to have a maximum
depth limit of only 70 feet. At depths greater than this, the
oxygen in the breathing gas becomes more and more toxic as
depth is increased.
Oxygen which is necessary to live becomes toxic
when the pressure is increased above atmospheric. Oxygen
toxicity comes on very rapidly, usually with no warning. The
main effect is convulsions during which the diver drowns. If a
diver is going to use more than one breathing gas during a
dive, it is absolutely essential that the diver know which tank
and regulator delivers which mix. - Ron Simmons.

A local open water diving instructor led five
customers on a trip from Cozumel to the mainland to dive in
several cenotes near Tulum. Their first dive at Grand Cenote
was without incident. During the second dive of the day, at
Cenote Temple of Doom, the guide led the clients out of the
cavern region and into a cave passage known as the Madonna
Passage. There were two warning signs near the passage
entrance, which they ignored.
After swimming down the passage for a while, the
guide turned back and found several of the other divers
missing. Returning to the cavern zone, he found two divers
out of air and one very low. He surfaced and swapped tanks
with a client who had remained behind. He then went back to
retrieve the others. He found one woman out of air but still
alive and took her to the surface. He searched again and found
a second woman and a man, both dead. The first woman was
taken to a hospital, where she died later in the day.

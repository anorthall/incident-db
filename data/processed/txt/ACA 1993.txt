The relative reliability can be esti-

1. Multiple references including news

2. Caver accounts by participants, as
given to the editor; caver accounts by
participants in newsletters or on elec-

3. Second-hand caver accounts.
4. Newspaper accounts.
I would also like to point out that one
may hear criticism of an incident ac-
count from American Caving Accidents.
If you do, find out if the person being
critical (undoubtedly a participant or an
acquaintance) sent a report on the inci-
dent to the editor. If that person did, you
may give credence to the complaint. If
that person did not send information,
he/she has absolutely nothing to com-
plain about. If you don't send the infor-

have only yourself to blame when that

The editorials at the start of an issue
(there are none in this issue) represent
a particular point of view, as does any
editorial, and are sometimes intended to
be controversial, with the intent of pro-

One caver was nearly killed in a dig
when it collapsed (1-9) and a citizen was
killed in a dirt collapse into an under-
ground hole (4-24C). A farmer dumped
a log into an entrance sink (8-25).
(s) Stuck
Cavers usually get out of being stuck
with help from companions (7-31, 11-
6A) but one was freed by rescuers
(Spring B), one freed herself with a res-
cue in progress (2-22), and one was not
gotten out alive (5-30B).
(t) Trapped
Two cavers were trapped behind a
stuck caver (5-30C).
(x) Exhaustion
One on a long vertical ascent (1-3)
and one on a short entrance climb (4-3A)
(o) Other
One caver stepped into a hole and
severely twisted an ankle (4-3B), one
suffered internal bleeding from an oper-
ation prior to the trip (8-7), one poked a
drill bit into his eye (11-3), and another
had an entrance gate slam down on his
hand (12-28).
Fatalities
There were five incidents that re-
sulted in ten fatalities. One will be re-
garded by many as unrelated to caving
(4-24C) since it was an earth collapse
into a void with subsequent suffocation,
but this is similar to many dig scenarios
that cavers increasingly engage in. One
was a caver stuck head-down in a verti-
cal constriction, dying of compressive
asphyxia (5-30B). This was the third in
recent years to die while stuck despite
being within reach of rescuers who
worked for hours to no avail. Six spe-
lunkers died in a flood during a heavy
rain that had been forcast (7-23), though
a seventh managed to survive. This may
be the most to die in a single incident in
the history of American caving. A rock
climber died in a sea cave trying to use
ill-fitting ascenders in a cold surf (10-
12). Finally, a spelunker died in a six- to
eight-foot fall, probably because he was
not wearing a helmet (11-20).

and vomiting and was unable to keep
any fluids down. By Sunday, March 14,
three other members of his group exited

he was severely dehydrated. An IV was

hours and the second in a 1.5 hour pe-

significant and Karlin was able to stand
without dizziness, which also improved
his spirits.

********** November 1, 1992
On Sunday, November 1, 1992, a
group of five, Rick Haley, Jim Sherrell,
Mike Roos, Steve Murphy and Dave
Jackson, entered the 28-mile Crevice
Cave in Missouri. They intended to go to
the Shotgun Barrels and push leads to-
ward the nearby 18-mile Berome Moore
Cave. Rain was in the forecast and as
they descended the 130-foot Echo Pit
entrance, it began to rain. As they pro-
ceeded along the cave, the smell of sew-
age increased. Further up the cave they
could see that the water levels in the
cave were rising. Outside it rained 2 to
z2.5 inches in three hours. They began
encountering more sewage than ex-
pected, as it was washed from the partly
residential land above. This was enough
for Haley turned back. The others
continued on.
As Haley headed back the water con-
tinued to rise until he was in waist-deep
sewage. Ata 70-foot dome he encountered
a thunderous waterfall and at Echo Pit
there were two waterfalls coming down.
He put on an extra polypropylene shirt
and a trash bag with head hole under his
coveralls and put the head hood up. The
pit was a raging torrent of water with
water-driven wind whipping the foam
and spray about. He decided to go for it
and arrived at the top about 1:00 PM.
The rest turned back at the first point
where they thought the rising water
would actually trap them in the cave.

set up a haul system. Rescuers hauled
her up, forcing her painfully through a

went out for buckets and beams to
bridge the pit. Some heat packs were
placed in the victim's clothing.
When the buckets arrived the water
was up to the victim's lower lip. Amaz-
ingly, Bittle was still conscious but later
he remembered little of what went on at
that point. They bailed, hauling the
buckets up and out, dumping the water
and rocks away from the edge. Soon the
water was down to Bittle's chest. They
tried the come-along again to no avail.

and soon they could reach below his
waist. Using a rope tied to the webbing
under Bittle's armpits (the come-along
was slow to release and caused the vic-
tim a lot of plus by then there was
plenty of manpower) they pulled again
and finally managed to move him. With
a few more pulls he was free. With a seat
harness fitted, he was pulled from the
sink it was 3:45 A.M.
He was transported across muddy
fields by ATV to a waiting ambulance. At
the emergency room it was speculated
that his temperature may have been as
low as 85Â° F. Bittle had suffered only
bruises, a touch of frostbite, abraded fin-
gertips, a small facial burn, and a sore
ankle. He was very lucky to be alive.

Comments: If this isn't an inspira-
tion to potential victims everywhere to
just hang in there, I can't imagine what
would be. Bittle made mistakes, as Tay-
lor points out at length, including going
by himself and not taking the clue of the
rain having caused the slumping of his
previous efforts. But digs are a boring,
difficult work and it is common for de-
termined diggers to be on the job alone.
Let this episode be a warning to us all.

The oral medications were discon-
tinued - the victim was again weakening
That afternoon cavers from the sur-
face arrived bringing more medication.
Another two liters of IV was given with
vitamin B injected into the infusion. In-
jections of anti-nauseant and antibiotics
were administered After some time the
anti-parasite pills were again given.
Meanwhile, two companions returned
to the surface to prepare for a possible
rescue.
By Wednesday Meyers could keep
fluids down and could eat some Melba
toast that evening. On Thursday Mey-
ers felt better and was able to start out,
accompanied directly by the EMT and
supported by the rest. The route to the
surface is mainly a series of vertical
drops. They made good progress and
used a haul system set up at the longest
pit. The victim was out before the end of
the day.

-ankle injury
April 3 B
On Saturday, April 3, a group of cav-
ers entered the Carmichael Entrance of
Mammoth Cave [National Park] in cen-
tral Kentucky. They were heading for
Echo River to clean up the remains of
some old tour boats and rotting pier
wood. At about 11:45 A.M. they were
about 0.25 miles along Sillimans Avenue
and about 2.5 miles from the entrance.
At that point, Johnette Gentry stepped
on a loose rock or into an unnoticed hole
and severely twisted an ankle, collaps-
ing to the ground. The group had be-
come spread out, but those nearby
helped Gentry assess the injury. The
boot was left on for support and she was
helped to her feet. Gentry wanted to
continue but was over-ruled and it was
decided that she should exit with help
from another caver. The accompanying
ranger, with the key to the gate, had to
go with the victim also.
Half way back to the Snowball Dining
Room, the ranger went ahead for more
help and a wheeled dolly. The victim and
her assistant were to wait at the Dining
Room - an elevator and a golf cart there
were out of service. The victim waited
there for 20 minutes but was getting
cold and SO they continued until met by
a group returning with the dolly. Though
it probably wasn't necessary, the victim
was wheeled to near the entrance where
she had to climb two flights of stairs, one
of 15 steps and one of 182. An X-ray later
determined that the ankle was only se-
verely sprained.

Rockpile Caves,
California
Be -inability to ascend
April 19
On Saturday, April 19, a group of
cavers visited the Rockpile Caves in the
foothills of the Sierra-Nevada Moun-
tains in central California. The cavers
were of varied amounts of experience.
The caves are mainly pits and are
known to have bad air in the lower
levels. One pit was done and the cavers
rigged a second. The known depth of this
pit was such that they suspected the
rope might be too short. The leader of
the group selected an experienced caver
who stated he had practiced changing
over from descent to ascent without get-
ting off the rope.
The caver rappelled and indeed
found the rope to be about three feet
short. He switched to ascent and started
up but in an hour had made almost no
progress. Another rope was on hand SO
the leader rigged this and descended He
found the caver had two Gibbs ascend-
ers in a Frogsetup, but no chest harness
or bungie loop. The leader tied some
webbing as a chest harness and the
caver was able to ascend.

Lechuguilla Cave,
New Mexico
Ac caver fall
May 16
On Saturday, May 15, a group of cav-
ers entered Lechuguilla Cave in the
Guadalupe Mountains of southern New
Mexico. The cave has over 60 miles of
passage and it is common for cavers to
enter with bivouac gear for a stay of
several days, as this groupintended. The
cavers proceeded to a bivouac site at the
Deep Seas, reaching it at about 7:00 P.M.
They left their camp gear, rested briefly,
and headed into the Western Borehole
to do some photography and acclimatize
to the warm conditions in the cave. They
returned to camp and were in bed by
midnight. Their sleep was disturbed by
the arrival of a second group of four and
their noisy dinner at 12:30 A.M.
The next morning the cavers split up
into three equal mapping teams. They
agreed on a common meeting place at
station EY 95. One team, led by Peter
Jones (42) and including John Rowland
and Doug Kent, left camp at 11:00 A.M.
and just before noon had arrived at the
Leaning Tower of Lechuguilla, the far-
thest Jones had been in the cave. As the
group were supposed to depart the main
route at around EY 75, Jones decided to
find a station and see how far they had
to go. He spotted the blue of a survey
marker on a small hill just beyond the
Tower and found it was EY 69. As he
came back down the slope, he placed his
left foot on a solid surface with knobby
projections. In stepping down, however,
his right foot came down on loose mate-
rial and it shot away, causing him to
twist and distort the left leg and ankle-
his left boot had a too-firm grip on the
surface.
There was immediate pain, but Jones
hoped it was just a sprain and would be
OK after some rest. He dispatched Kent
to return to camp and retreive the biv-
ouac gear. Rowland had EMT experi-
ence. He removed the boot and started
devising a splint for it. Several of the
others arrived and they made a splint

The group was prepared for this. How-
ever, shortly after doing the swim, the
smell of acetylene impurities was no-
ticed and one caver noticed her cave
pack was the culprit, having swelled a
bit and emiting the offensive odor.
This caver had not put her carbide in
a waterproof container and now, discov-
ering that it was contaminated with
water and would continue to outgas,
wondered if she should dump it in the
water. Fortunately the others realized
that a pound of carbide dumped in the
water all at once might provide enough
acetylene for a tremendous explosion, as-

was a ways away.

Comments: McLuckie comments
on the fact that this caver knew how to
use a carbide lamp but didn't really un-
derstand what carbide and acetylene
were all about. While she was not a
novice, the caver obviously lacked some
essential information about carbide
lamps. Decent training should have pre-
vented this incident.

5. The spelunkers were left to their
own devices by their guide at the
point when they were tired and most
susceptible to an accident.
6. The victim was head-down in the
slot, and had entered the descent in
this orientation apparently on advice
from his guide.
7. Once the initial fall occurred, a
decision was made to exit the cave. If
outside rescue had been called at this
time the result could easily have been
different.
8. The spelunkers were dressed in
"light, casual clothing." A 44Â° cave is
a serious hypothermia risk and re-
quires caving suits and thermal un-
derwear.
9. It was suggested that the victim's
grip would have been better if he had
been wearing gloves. If his hands
were cold this is probably true. Many
cavers take gloves off when climbing
to have better dexterity. It may be
that a warm hand can grip better
without gloves.
10. With tourist cavers the experience
level is probably low and individuals
are poorly equipped to assess their
exposure to danger, state of exhaus-
tion, quality of equipment, equip-
ment and techniques required, and
the like. It is thus imperative that
they be treated as novices and closely
supervised.
Once Coughlin was stuck, head-
down, it may be that he was doomed.

Ae-inverted ascent
June 26 B
At about 11:00 A.M. on Saturday, June
26, a group of five cavers entered Cross-
roads Cave near Woodland Church in
Bath County, Virginia. On a previous
trip an unexplored rift had been found
about 10,000 feet from the entrance.
The group had brought ropes in order to
push this lead. The rift proved to be
about 200 feet long with a 30-foot rope
drop at the end. At about 3:30 P.M. the
group was exiting and Earl Copp (38)
started up this drop. Unfortunately, he
failed to rig the main line into his chest

about a step or two before losing his grip
on the rope and inverting. In the pro-

at 10:00 P.M. and reached the victim

Big Room. Jason Kyler (21) was coming
last along the traverse when a loud
"pop" was heard and Kyler said, "Oh,
shit!" His left foot had slipped off a hold
and caught again, twisting and injuring
the ankle.
His nearest companion was Garrett
Czmor, 20 feet away, who asked Kyler if
he was alright. Kyler replied that it re-
ally hurt and he felt faint. Czmor strug-
gled back through the mud, yelling that
Kyler should put his feet in the water
and lean back against the wall, SO he
wouldn't collapse in the water. Kyler
didn't faint. He soon recovered his
senses and the others were called back.
They examined the leg, and suspected a
tendon torn just above the ankle. One
person was sent out of the cave, found
the two who had already exited and
made a call to the NCRC. They also went
to nearby Butler Cave to get help from
the cavers there.
The cavers with the victim waited an
hour and then decided to get the Kyler
out of the wet passage. They were able
to help him along, with one in front and
one behind, and were soon back at the
pit. After waiting another hour, Kyler
was becoming cold SO they helped him
up the pit and and soon made it out to
the entrance.
A rescuer with a rope and a large first
aid kit arrived and a splint was fash-
ioned and fixed in place with duct tape.
The victim was then belayed by one
caver while the other two descended just
in front of Kyler down the 200 foot talus
slope outside the entrance. A rain had
made the rocks very slick and they did a
lot of sliding on their back sides. A road
was some distance away and they first
tried letting the victim hobble along with
the aid of a crutch made from a tree
limb. This proved too painful SO cavers
made a drag litter and proceeded some
distance before becoming exhausted.
The victim insisted on continuing by
crawling before additional help arrived
and the carry was completed. It was
dawn when the rescuers got back to
their camp. X-rays showed no broken
bones.

Cliff Cave,
Missouri
AAf-flood
July 23
On Friday, July 23, a group entered
Cliff Cave in Cliff Cave County Park in
Saint Louis County, Missouri. They were
adult counselors and boys, wards of the
state, all from Saint Joseph's Home for
troubled youths, run by Catholic Chari-
ties of the Saint Louis, Missouri, Arch-
diocese. Others from the Home had
explored the 1,500-foot cave earlier in
the week. Since that trip, however, the
park had been closed with barricades
erected at the driveway entrance be-
cause of flooding of the nearby Missis-
sippi River The flooding affected the low
lying areas of the park, not the cave. This
group had passed the barriers and
walked almost a mile to reach the cave.
Before they entered the cave, a neighbor
had apparently stopped by and warned
one of the counselors of the flood danger,
especially with the given forecast of
thunderstorms. Some distance from the
entrance, and a bit higher, are sinkholes,
one with a normally dry streambed lead-
ing to it. Moreover, the soils were satu-
rated from recent rains. The cave
usually carries a few inches of water
flow from the back part of the cave to a
resurgence at the entrance.
Apparently a large group entered the
cave but some turned back a short way
in at the end of walking passage. Seven,
two adults (one male, one female) and
five boys (10 or 11), continued. The boys
reportedly asked the counselors if the
cave was safe, if water could get in, and
were told that it could not. The Home
later reported that before arranging the
trips they had met with a park ranger
who had not said anything about the
cave being dangerous or conveying flood
water during storms. There was heavy
rain that afternoon.
As the group penetrated deepinto the
cave they encountered ankle deep water.

run out of light and continued to move
about, making their rescue difficult.
Here it proved to be impossible to out-
think the lost cavers.
Dasher comments on the impressive
number of cavers that not only knew the
cave but knew the proper names for
passages and rooms in the cave, making
rescue organization and operations
much easier.

-stuck caver
July 31 B
On Saturday, July 31, a group of ten
cavers were doing a through-trip of
Bone-Norman Cave in West Virginia. At
a constriction called "The pinch" they
had doubts that two of the group, Harry
Fair and George O'Neill, would be able
to make it. Three went through but
when Fair tried, as speculated, he could
not make it, though he tried several
orientations. O'Neill then tried, failing
several times but continuing to strip
down until he was shirtless, greased
with vaseline, and sliding on plastic laid
down in the constriction. With one com-
panion pulling and another pushing, he
made it through. Fair had to retrace the
route in, by himself.

August 7
On Thursday, August 5, two cavers
entered Scott Hollow Cave, a 20-mile-
long system in Monroe County, West
Virginia. They intended a three day ex-
ploration and survey trip to the Birthday
Pit area. Two cavers, Mike McFall and
Michelle Bostic, entered and joined
them at their upstream camp on Satur-
day to help with the survey. When Bostic
arrived at the camp she was suffering
abdominal discomfort in the area of the
abdomen where she had had surgery six
weeks before. Bostic was in good spirits
and no one was alarmed at her problem.

They proceeded across a stream sev-

up a steep, 50-foot, mud-covered break-
down pitch and through about 200 feet
of three- to four-foot high crawlway. The
group reached the Register Room at
about 2:30 PM. At this point one of the
support crew, Ken Carstens (45), told
the others he felt "ill" and "dizzy."
The group allowed him to rest and
the two most-knowledgable left to find
the easiest way to the Aborigine Avenue,
a filming objective. However, within mo-
ments of sitting down to have some food,
Carstens felt worse and felt he should lie
down. After a few more minutes he
started shaking uncontrollably and
stated that if he passed out it was be-
cause of hypoglycemia. He complained
of a very dry mouth. They tried to give
him water and fruit juice and turned on
one of the video lights to try to warm
him. He was wrapped in extra clothing
and garbage bags. By 2:45 he no longer
knew where he was and could only give
his name and those of a few companions.
The group realized they needed to
stabilize the victim and exit to seek med-
ical aid. Two set out to find the two who
had departed for Aborigine Avenue but
quickly returned after realizing they
might get lost. The other two soon re-
turned. Carsten's condition had gotten
worse, and it was assumed this was due
to hypoglycemia, compounded by
hypothermia and dehydration. It was
decided that two would leave to get help
while the rest tried to keep the victim
stable. They kept him talking and took
turns rubbing his extremities.
The two exited the cave at 3:45 P.M.,
drove to Jamestown, and at 4:00 P.M.
notified the Fentress County Sheriff.
The Fentress County Rescue Squad and
Pall Mall Fire Department responded.
Eleven of these rescuers were led into
the cave to the victim. They were with-
out proper cave gear but had gear to
treat the victim as well as a Stokes litter.
The victim was given an IV and placed
in the litter. Other rescuers were on the
way; East Tennessee Grotto Cave Res-
cue and Fentress and Cumberland
County Rescue Squad personnel soon
arrived. The Cumberland personnel had
heard that the victim had been drinking,
had fallen, and was "foaming at the
mouth." Still, the various rescuers
worked well together and the victim was
transported to the entrance by 9:45 P.M.

walked across a field to the sink he no-
ticed a man driving a tractori the same
field, some distance away.
About 400 feet into the cave he
stopped at a pool to look for a particular
endangered cave salamander, the
Gurinophilius Palleucus, with which he
was apparently familiar. Suddenly there
came a thunderous sound of collapse
from the direction of the entrance. The
great rumbling continued and he
jumped up and raced toward the sound.
Biddix immediately thought of the inno-
cent-looking farmer-was he filling in
the sink? What was happening? Maybe
the farmer did not like cavers.
He rounded a corner and could see
daylight amid swirling clouds of dust.
The sounds had stopped and he cau-
tiously approached. At the portal he was
faced with a 2- to 3-foot diameter log
some 15 feet long with a length of large
chain still wrapped around it. In a pile
with the log were several new boulders.
All was quiet SO he exited and climbed
out of the sink. There was no one around
and no sign of the tractor.

Comments: Being solo had nothing
to do with the incident. The lesson is that
it is a good idea to make contact with a
landowner or tenant farmer before en-
tering a privatly-owned cave. After all,
it is his cave and if he decides to close it,
that is his business.

On Sunday, September 19, three cav-
ers, Rick Haley, Aaron Addison, and Bill
Rudolf, visited an unexplored pit in
Saint Genevieve County, Missouri. The
entrance was tight and it appeared pos-
sible to chimney as far down as they
could see. Addison climbed down and
reported that it continued. They rigged
a 170-foot rope and Rudolf descended as
far as Addison. They both chimneyed
out, huffing and puffing, as Haley
changed into cave gear. Haley com-
mented that they were both out of shape.
Haley descended, using an electric
headlamp, to an offset about 15 feet
down where he applied a rope pad.
There looked to be another 80 feet of
drop. He called up and asked if Addison
wanted him to wait or rappel down the
rest of the drop. Addison replied "What-
ever." Haley decided to wait. Soon Addi-
son, also using an electric light, came
down, again out of breath. Haley noticed
that he too was short of breath, even
though he had been sitting and waiting.
They began to suspect bad air.
Addison got out a Bic lighter and it
refused to light. Was it defective? Addi-
son and Haley dug a spare carbide lamp
out of a pack and tried to light it
refused. They passed it up to Rudolf,
outside, and he was able to light it. When
he handed it down into the pit, the flame
flickered and sputtered. When it was
passed down to the offset, it went out.
They grabbed the pad, pulled the rope
up the offset drop, and chimneyed up.
"It resembled rock climbing at 14,000
feet." Addison and Haley both had head-
aches for several hours. At no time had
they detected an odor.

Comments: Haley points out that
they were very lucky one of them had
not gone down the second drop. In the
thrill of coming upon a virgin pit, there
was excitement and haste in the air. And
if one had descended, and become un-
conscious, would not a second caver
have descended to help? And if the two
became unconscious, why wouldn't the
third go down? He termed this "The
Lemming Effect." All three cavers could
have died.

Cave in Van Buren County, Tennessee.
The entrance leads to a body-hole, a

series of climb-downs, and a crawlway
that yields the low, wide Attic Room.
Holes in the floor of this room drop to a
ledge 25 feet down. From there a 100-
foot drop reaches the Hartselle Cham-
ber, a two-acre room where the route
from another entrance comes in and pits
lead on. A 155-foot pit leads directly to
the lower section of the cave via a long
and steeply sloping climb, a slope de-
scent, a 30-foot walking canyon and a
25-foot-deep pit. At the bottom of this a
muddy stream passage can be followed
for 200 feet to a second 25-foot pit.
Below this is a muddy room with a pas-
sage leading downstream to a sump.
On the way down to the Attic area, a
boulder was dislodged in a tight slot
below the entrance, making it difficult
to get by. They proceeded to the
Hartselle Chamber where they split up.
Andy Porter would lead four cavers to
the bottom of the cave while Alan
Cressler would do some other pits with
three of the others.
Porter's group proceeded down the
155-foot drop and on to the first 25-foot
pit. There Porter found a rope already in
place (apparently this is left rigged). He
rigged in his rack, leaned back to load
the rope and looked up at the anchor.
The canyon above was 20 feet high, 3 to
4 feet wide at the bottom, and wider
higher up. There was a large mass of
breakdown perched about halfway up
(five feet overhead), consisting of two
large blocks with an assortment of
smaller rocks and mud on top (about 6
to 10 thousand pounds total). The floor
of the canyon was smooth mud, with no
signs of rockfall. The rope was rigged
over this mass, the rope coming down
the backside and closing on itself with a
bowline, making a slip-noose of the
whole loop. Porter could see that the
rope rubbed against three rocks on the
near, left corner of the mass and thought
that it was not a very good rig. Still, it
seemed usable. The group continued,
getting soaked where a stream made a
waterfall at one of the drops.
After reaching the bottom, they
headed back to try the pits that Cressler
was rigging. Porter, ahead of the rest,
reached the first 25-foot drop and
climbed slowly up using a Texas rig.
When he got over the lip, he saw one of
the three rocks the rope had been rub-
bing, lying on the floor. He looked up and
could see that it was still rubbing the
other two. He thought, "One of those
rocks could dislodge and hit someone."

line rig, so he pulled up on the rope to get

As he rappelled, he hunched over,
watching his progress. He chanced to
bring his knee up under the pack, driv-

Bowden Cave,
West Virginia
diabetic
November 13
At around noon on Saturday, Novem-
ber 13, a large group entered Bowden
Cave in Randolph County, West Vir-
ginia. These were Boy Scouts and their
adult trip leaders. They were engaged in
a through-trip, from the Main Entrance
to the third entrance, which normally
takes two to three hours. After some
time, they reached the "Pinch," about
500 feet from the third entrance. One of
the adults was unable to fit through this,
SO another counselor, who knew the
cave, volunteered to accompany him
back to the Main Entrance.
The two headed back, but the leader
was a diabetic and apparently began to
suffer from low blood sugar. Becoming
disoriented the two got into a maze-like
side area. The leader realized they had
lost the way and they sat down to wait
for help. One fell asleep but the other
could the first was snoring too

Lechuguilla Cave,
New Mexico
-frayed rope
November 29
On Sunday, November 29, a group of
cavers was in Lechuguilla Cave in the
Guadalupe Mountains of southern New
Mexico. This was the second day of a
five-day stay. At the High Hopes climb
they ascended. The climb is two pitches,
the first of 150 feet and the second of
about 50 to 60 feet. A short ledge with a
handline for safety connects the two
pitches. The first ascent was rigged with
the anchor point, a flowstone column,
about 25 feet above the ledge with the
anchor point itself out of sight of anyone
ascending the ropes, as the flowstone
above the ledge curves back. The group
planned to do this climb three days in a
row to pursue their objectives.
The fourth caver up apparently
watched his ascenders a little too in-
tently and missed getting off at the
ledge. He suddenly found himself near
the anchor staring in horror at a rope
fray - the sheath was gone and the core
had only 7 strands remaining!
The rope was rerigged at the ledge to
some natural anchors in flowstone.
Reference: Mark Fritzke, personal
communication, Nov 27, 1994.
Comments: A rope rigged as this
one was is very dangerous-it could not
be inspected by the people using it.
Worse, the reason for the fray was
shards of sharp bedrock in the flow-
stone, in a natural groove where the rope
would lie, about two feet below the an-
chor. If you are rigging a rope that must
lie against the surface you must either
pad the surface or get rid of sharp edges,
and always regularly inspect such a rig
for damage.

404 December 1994 American Caving Accidents
The Tennessee Emergency Manage-
ment Agency was called and passed the
word to the various rescue agencies. The
first rescuers, from the Putnam County
Rescue and Cumberland County Civil
Defense entered the cave at 5:00 P.M. but
were not equipped to descend the pit.
They did lower a medical kit and a cer-
vical collar was applied; they found that
her blood pressure was dropping. About
an hour later two paramedics reached
the victim and found that she had suf-
fered a collapsed lung. She was pack-
aged for transport. Word was sent for
oxygen and a helicoptor for transport
from the entrance. Rescue Squads from
Murfreesboro, Nashville, and Knoxville
were activated for the transport
through the cave. Brown reached the
entrance at 8:30 PM. She was then car-
ried down the hillside to a truck and
driven half of a mile to the helicopter.
She reached a hospital at 10:30 P.M. In
addition to the collapsed lung she had a
cracked L-1 vertebrae.

Co-slamming gate
December 28
In December a LEARN expedition
was pursuing the exploration and map-
ping of new passage in Lechuguilla Cave
in southern New Mexico. On Tuesday,
December 28, a group was exiting the
cave. At the culvert, Steve Reames went
through, pushed the gate open and
reached up to pull himself out. The gate
suddenly slammed down on this hand
resulting in a painful injury. Another
caver carried his pack, but Reames was
able to ascend the entrance pit using a
Texas rig. It was later found that the tip
of one finger had been fractured.

Comments: The victim was a certi-
fied cave diver, with experience in 55
non-training cave dives. He had recently
dived for four hours on a two-stage dive
reaching 4,000 feet from the entrance.
Mulhollin feels they were a bit ambitious
with the dive plan, neither having dived
for at least a month. Also, he did not
know at the time that this was the
victim's first scooter dive. He feels such
initial scooter work should not involve
stage complications and initially be done
in open water with safety drills. "IfAllen
was fighting the scooter and simulta-
neously having to deal with adjusting
bouancy, as his position near the floor on
the way in would suggest, he may have
built up a considerable amount of car-
bon dioxide during that short period of
time."
"The dive team did not run a guidline
to the surface as is recommended by
cave diving training organizations. In-
stead they relied on the permanent line
leading from direct sunlight into the
unlit interior of the system. That guide-
line runs several feet up the side of the
cave wall. If Allen was suffering the
effects of CO2 buildup on the way out,
the narrowing of visual perception com-
mon in such cases, combined with a lack
of bouancy control, would have effec-
tively put him off the line. If he was
relying on following the current out of
the cave and was not consciously aware
of the Devils Eye tunnel along the floor
he may have been very confused and
anxious when the apparent way out sud-
denly began to narrow much more than

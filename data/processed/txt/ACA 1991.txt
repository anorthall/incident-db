Lost Creek Siphon consists of a stream sink
that can be followed down a number of very wet
pitches. Because of the lack of space to rig out of
the waterfalls, the cave may best be done in the
winter. On December 18 two cavers were visit-
ing the cave. As they exited things went fine un-
til they got halfway up pit #2. At that point, the
cave was subject to the outside temperature
which had fallen to -25 degrees F, and ice had
accumulated on the rope. Everything they wore

administered and the arm was splinted with a
rack and blue-jean material. With the arm in a
sling she proceeded out, being belayed at ex-
posed places that included a crawl across a ledge
at the edge of one pit. At the 70-foot entrance pit,
she was put into a companion's rig that would
allow her to make it using one arm. There was no

This effort, surely as potentially newsworthy as

Both Cheve incidents were handled by essen-

Two Fatalities Using European
Vertical Equipment
And Techniques
By Steve Knutson
I
t was unusual for two American cavers to die in one year in non-
diving incidents. The very interesting aspect of this is that both
died because of European techniques or equipment. At Megawell (1-13)
a European rope, rigged in a typically American way, failed; at Cheve (3-
1), the victim was passing a European-style rebelay when he fell.
The Megawell incident would be clear-cut if the rope had failed due to
abrasion. The rope was tested later and found to be greatly inferior to
American caving rope in regard to abrasion, and the obvious conclusion
would be that if the victim had used American rope he would still be alive.
By the same token, if he had rigged the European rope in a European man-
ner, he again would have lived. The message would be -don't mix
styles and equipment or, at least, that European rope is incompatible with
American-style rigging. One of the main reasons Europeans use rebelays
is to keep their poor-quality rope from abrading.
Forensic analysis, however, seems to indicate the rope was chopped by
a falling rock rather than abraded by rubbing on a surface. I don't believe
American Caving Accidents

tend the victim during the self-rescue, and crews
on standby, ready to fly down if the victim be-
came incapacitated, the word was passed along
no publicity and there was none.
One has to suspect that the National Park
Service and the cavers administering the project
at Lechuguilla (the most publicized cave project
ever), even before the accident, desired media
exposure and either called it in or, when the in-
cident was discovered by the media, welcomed
it. The NPS might see it as increasing tourist at-
traction to the Carlsbad area, thereby potentially
enlarging their budget. If either NPS or LCP
didn't want publicity, it surely would not have
occurred to the extent it did.
I don't really want to make an issue of this
particular instance of publicity. Yet I believe
that if one thinks publicity is good for caving,
there are other ways to produce it. It is difficult
for me to see how it is beneficial to publicize ac-
cidents in this typically sensationalistic way.
The Cheve examples show that if you don't
want it, it is not inevitable.
American caving rope has been tested for such, so it is difficult to say
what would have occurred if American rope had been used.
In the Cheve incident, it seems clear that the crossing of the rebelay, not
the simple act of rappelling, resulted in the fall. This is not to infer that the
rebelay was unnecessary. Indeed, there was a slope of loose rocks above
the free portion of the drop, and the rebelay enabled one to rappel the free
portion without danger of the rope dislodging rocks from the slope.
Rather, I would like to urge cavers to be prudent in their use of rebelays.
If you are using American caving rope there is often no need for a rebelay,
even though the rope passes over edges and contacts walls.
In my own caving I don't tuse a re-anchor unless the rope begins to show
signs of wear, and you might be surprised by how much contact an Ameri-
can rope will put up with. Every time you cross a rebelay, you expose
yourself to danger that is not there in a continuous rappel. You attach
to the anchor, undo your rappel device, re-attach it to the rope past the an-
chor and unclip from the anchor. This process cost Chris Yeager his life.

Analysis:
At the request of the county coroner, a section
of the rope was sent to Pigeon Mountain Indus-
tries, a rope manufacturer, for testing. Their ob-
servations follow:
"The rope is 10 mm in diameter and has a
kernmantle construction with a braided sheath
over a twisted strand core. The sheath is thinner
and of lighter weight than is usual for American
caving ropes. The twisted core and thin sheath
make the rope exhibit greater stretch under load
than most static ropes used for caving. The elon-
gation was observed to be between 5.6 and 18.7
percent under loads from 200 to 1,000 pounds
(American caving rope stretches about two per-
cent under 200 lb load). The breaking strength
was found to be 2770 pounds (10 mm PMI tests
at 5800 lbs). In the abrasion resistance test, the
rope failed after 287 cycles (10 mm PMI sur-
vives 900 cycles). The pieces tested were taken
from the end of the rope off the upper section. It
should be noted that the part of the rope near the
ends usually tests out stronger than the middle
(where the failure occurred).
These are rather poor figures compared to
contemporary American caving rope but are not
so bad that the rope could not be used success-
fully. Recall that the first two up reported little
apparent abrasion, and signs of abrasion are
something about which most cavers are very
paranoid.

pounds, and with wet clothes and full caving and

These may or may not have been "killer"
bees. Any wild bees, wasps or hornets will at-
tack if their nest territory is disturbed. My expe-
rience is that disturbed bees act in an aggressive
manner and this is a tipoff that you are too close
to their nest. No calm behavior will work at that
point - it is time to jump and run. A large nest
as this was is very dangerous. If someone had
actually started rappelling this could have been
an even more serious situation. If nights are
cold, bees become inactive and can be dealt
with. Killer bees must be given even more re-
spect for they attack in a swarm and death can re-
sult from the hundreds of stings. The victims
here each received from 12 to 20 stings.
Analysis (by Donald G. Davis, a
beekeeper):
The unusually vicious stinging in this case is
consistent with the behavior of Africanized or
"killer" honeybees, which have spread from
South and Central America through Mexico in
recent years. These bees have reached southern
Texas and are likely soon to become a cave-en-
trance hazard in the warmer parts of the southern
United States. Solution pockets and overhangs
around cave mouths can be ideal honeybee col-
ony sites.
Where hostile bees are present, the safest pro-
cedure is to move past them at night, as far from
the nest as possible, while directing lights away.
In the dark, bees may crawl, but do not fly freely.
If in doubt, use red light, which bees can't see. It
is also best to be downwind from bees, since
they attack by both sight and scent.
EL CHOREADERO,
CHIAPAS, MEXICO
January 28
Cc - caver fall
On Monday, January 28, a party of four cav-
ers, Peter Haberland, Don Coons, Rubin Com-
stock and Matt Oliphant, entered the upper
entrance of El Choreadero, a three km through-
trip stream cave in Chiapas, Mexico. The stream
is quite small during good weather in the dry
season. They proceeded with a pull-down ex-
cursion to the lower entrance. Of the two dozen
drops along the way, about half can be jumped
down, landing in a pool. The other half must be
rigged with a rope doubled through the anchor at
the top without a knot and both free ends at the
bottom, so that the rope can be derigged from the
bottom by pulling on one of the ends. Thus one
can proceed past numerous descents using only
one rope.
Partway through the cave they descended a
seven meter drop, and Coons and Oliphant pro-
ceeded to the next pitch to place a bolt, leaving
the other two to effect the pulling down of the
rope. They pulled on one end but failed to ob-
serve a tangle in the other portion. When this
reached the anchor, it jammed. To free the rope

What this means is that once you rig in to the

stead, you rappel until you come to a projection
of the wall which would contact the rope. At that
point, the rope is anchored, leaving a short loop
of slack in the part of the rope coming from
above to provide a foothold. You must attach to
the anchor and put weight on this, detach the
rappel device, re-attach it to the part of the rope
continuing down, then step in the loop, take
weight off the anchor, release the attachment to
the anchor and finally put weight on the rappel
device and continue the rappel. It is easy to see
that rigging in such a manner is not as safe as
simply anchoring the rope at the top and letting
it hang, but it does preserve the rope.
On Monday, February 25, a group of six cav-
ers traversed the four to five km of cave to Camp
II with camp gear, a trip that takes from seven to
ten hours. The next day, two returned to the sur-
face while the other four rigged toward Camp
III, another five km further. That same day, an-
other four went with camp gear to Camp II from
the surface. The two going out, Peter Bosted and
Peter Haberland, agreed to come back in with
more food to extend the stay of some of the oth-
ers already in the cave.
For the return to Camp II they were joined by
two cavers, James Brown and Chris Yeager (25)
who had been sitting out temporary problems-
Brown with a sprained shoulder and Yeager
with diarrhea. To facilitate travel through the
cave, they paired up with the pairs entering the
cave an hour apart.
Thus on Friday, March 1, Bosted and Brown
entered at 12:30 p.m. with Haberland and
Yeager going at 1:30, for a seven day stay.
While descending the fourth drop Yeager gave a
shout, explaining to Haberland at the bottom
that he had just done his first in-cave rebelay.
This was exuberance - he was having no
trouble and didn't need to ask for direction.
They pressed on, reaching Saknussem's well,
the start of the wet pitches, by 4:30.
Near the bottom of Saknussem's Well is a
short, roped up-climb that facilitates access to
the narrow passages at the start of a series of wet
ones, the Salmon Ladders. At the top of this
pitch, Yeager dropped his rack and had to bor-
row Haberland's to go back down and retrieve
it. They proceeded and arrived at the end of the
wet series of drops and passage at 7:40. From
there the way to camp leads through some dry
chambers and passage with flagging at junc-
tions. They lost the way for 30-45 minutes, but
the added dry activity served to warm them thor-

Haberland, going first, would not yell frope
until he was behind a boulder near the bottom.
From there it was only a half hour to Camp II.
Haberland went down, spending five to ten min-

FERN CAVE, AL
March 11
Bf - high water flow
On Monday, March 11, a group of seven cav-
ers, Bryce Bolton, Dave Colatosti, Mike Horne,
Cecile James, Sandy Knapp, Mac McElroy and
John Williams, entered Fern Cave, in Alabama.
They were from VPI Grotto in Virginia and re-
portedly experienced and competent. They had
been doing other pits in that area on prior days
and had just then decided to go to Fern to do 404
foot Surprise Pit.
Only James had done that pit before and ap-
parently didn' 'tremember it well, but they talked
to a caver who knew it about the rigging. He also
told them it would likely be misty in the pit and
difficult to communicate from top to bottom.
They obtained some whistles to deal with that
problem. It had not rained for five days, but the
ground was still wet and water levels were high.
They entered the cave at 2:30 p.m., followed
the inflowing stream to where it dropped over
the edge of the pit, and, after crawling out onto
the ledge, found two large eyebolts and a piton,
all seeming quite solid. This was as they had
been told so they proceeded to rig the pit there.
What they didn't know is that there is a second
rig point, further along, to be used in wet
weather.
The plan was to have four descend, two go
back up, two go down and continue until all had
done it once and one of them done it twice, but
no more than four on the bottom at one time.
James felt moved to comment that she didn't
member the rigging point looking like the one
they were using, but rope grooves near the an-
chors showed this was a commonly used rig
point.
They proceeded. Knapp went down first as
only she and James had done "long" pits before.

Analysis:
The victim was lucky to be wearing a hardhat,
but such a fall points out the need for a proper
chinstrap. A helmet should not come off in a fall.
One also has to criticize the lack of protection at
this exposed pit. The ease of getting across re-
portedly depends on body size - the small
scouts should have been spotted or aided across
or given a handline to use. Perhaps they were un-
aware of the exposure. Still, the scout master ap-
parently learned a lesson about confusion in
large parties.
In an otherwise unrelated footnote, one of the
cavers to reach the victim initially was tragically
killed the following day when he fell asleep at
the wheel on I-95.
LECHUGUILLA CAVE, NM
March 31
Ar - rockfall
Saturday, March 30, was the first day of the
Spring expedition at Lechuguilla Cave in
Carlsbad Caverns National Park, New Mexico.
Lechuguilla is the deepest cave in the United
States and is one of the longest as well, with
some 60 miles of mapped passage. The distance
to the limits of exploration requires multi-day
trips, but the bivouacs are simplified by the
warm temperatures in the cave. A complication
is the rule that all body waste must be carried
from the cave. Several roped drops are required
to get into the main part of the cave.
At 1:00 p.m. a group of five entered the cave,
led by Mike Mansur and including Dr. Stephen
Mosberg, Emily Davis Mobley (40), Bill Bau-
man and Bob Addis. A 24 hour limit had been
imposed on all trips for this expedition to allow
everyone a chance to get into the cave. The
group's objective was a climb in the Fubar Pas-
sage that had been attempted before but not
completed, and Mansur realized it might be a
problem to get there, do the climb and get out
under the time limit.
Despite a lot of large passage, there is much

An hour later three cavers from Richmond,

One of the scout groups decided to exit and
found the trail of flagging and followed it. In the
Lipps Maze area they lost it and became con-
fused. They passed within feet of the obscure
connection to the final passage out but failed to
notice it. They decided to wait where they were.
Two hours later the Richmond cavers came
upon them, shivering but gaining some warmth
from trash bags, space blankets and candles. As
they were led toward the entrance, they met an-

Br - ladder-fall
In the summer, Mark Madson and Greg Han-

Montana. A newspaper article described one in
Peterson Meadow between Dry Creek and
Blodged Gulch, with a ladder going down into
it. They located the cave and the 40-foot pit just
inside the entrance did indeed have a wooden
ladder. The pit was rigged from four stout poles
that crossed it with a backup to a tree just out-
side. A second rope was rigged just to the tree
and passed over the edge of the pit. The old, rot-
ten ladder spanned the pit below the poles.
They rappelled past the ladder with no prob-
lem but when Madson started back up, the lad-
der suddenly swung downward, then stopped.
They discussed what to do and it was decided
that Madson would switch to the backup rope.
He did so and Hanson stood below to hold both
ropes and hopefully swing Madson to one side if
the ladder fell. They were both able to exit with-
out further incident using the backup rope. The
ladder was found to be still hanging by just a sin-
gle, rusty nail.

SOLDIER'S CAVE, CA
July 27
Ao - shoulder dislocation
At 10 a.m. on Saturday, July 27, a group of
five cavers entered Soldiers Cave in the Sierra
Nevada foothills in California. The cave is
within Sequoia National Park. The cavers pro-
ceeded down 20- and 60-foot rappels to the
Waiting Room. At around noon one of the
group, Rob Dreyer (40), was climbing in some
breakdown just below that room when his
shoulder dislocated. His companions came to
his aid, but any movement of the shoulder was
very painful and it was decided that help would
be required to get him out of the cave. The cave
is cool, about 45 degrees, so Dreyer was made as
comfortable as possible and all extra clothing
was gathered. Two companions then went for
help, notifying the Park Service of the problem
at about 1:30 p.m.
Rescuers began to arrive by 3 p.m. and medi-
cal equipment was brought in by helicopter. At
5 p.m. an EMT and two others entered to tend
the victim while other personnel began to rig the
drops for hauling. Unexpectedly, it proved pos-
sible to use two-way radios between the en-
trance and the Waiting Room, thus simplifying
coordination of the efforts. As Dreyer was being
hauled up the 60, the shoulder relocated, and
subsequent work was easier since the victim was
in less pain. Everyone was out of the cave by 3
a.m.

Jef Levin, NSS Accident Report, unpublished,
undated, two pages.
Analysis:
This is another case of a shoulder (or other
joint) that has suffered dislocation in the past
and does so again in a cave. Admittedly, the vic-
tim hadn't had a problem in this regard for 18
years, but such a shoulder is a handicap and
should be recognized as such. Levin reflects
they might have been able to immobilize the af-
fected arm and had the victim ascend with one
arm, but the 60 is narrow near the top and there
were no extra ropes to allow someone to ascend
alongside the victim and render aid. Warm
clothing was not brought in to the cavers waiting
with the victim until the rescue was underway.
RUTH CAVE, PA

Dr - rock fall
On a trip to Ruth Cave on Monday, July 29,
cavers were working on a dig in the Cricket
Room. They were bringing rocks down by tying
webbing around them and pulling. Chris
Brinker had one "watermelon sized" rock fall
unexpectedly, narrowly missing his head. They
aborted the dig at that point.

August 17
Cr - rock fall
On Saturday, August 17, a group of six cavers
entered Big Ridge Cave in Pennsylvania. They
rigged the first drop, a 125-foot pit, and Bob
Prowel went first. He found the rope ended 20
feet above the floor. He was able to get off rope
on a small, exposed ledge. Since he wasn't fa-
miliar with the cave, a second caver, Pat Min-
nick, descended to the ledge. It was decided the
rope needed to be re-rigged to provide more
length, and this was communicated to those at
the top. Then a caver coming through the gate
near the top of the pit dislodged a small rock
which went down the pit, hitting Minnick on one
shoulder. Minnick suffered a bruise and was in
"a lot of pain" but continued with the trip.

CLARKSVILLE CAVE, NY
September 2
Bs - stuck caver
At around 2:30 p.m. on Monday, September
2, a group of three cavers, Gary Lau, Mark
McNiff and Beverly Schwartz (30), entered
Clarksville Cave in Albany County, New York.
The first two had many years of caving experi-
ence; the last had two, including an NCRC
workshop earlier that summer. On a previous
trip, a dig site with airflow had been found adja-
cent to the Twinkle Room in the Ward section of
the cave. These three intended to pursue that dig
and proceeded to the site.
The dig was located at the end of a passage ex-
tending north from the Twinkle Room for about
30 feet. For most of its length it is too narrow,
about three feet wide and 18 inches high, for two
cavers to pass. It then makes a 90 degree bend to
the right, and slopes down at about 20 degrees
for the last ten feet which are too tight to allow
one to turn around. They took turns working on
it to keep anyone from becoming chilled in the
45 degree F, damp cave. In the dig passage there
was a "slight breeze." Schwartz went third and
worked on the dig for a while.
At p.m. she reached the end of her shift, but
when she tried to back out found she could not
get her hips past a tight place. After an hour and
a half and numerous attempts, it was decided her
clothes might be binding up. A companion was

alls and Polar Fleece thermal bottoms. Schwartz
took off her P F top, leaving her wearing a layer
of polypropylene. She was still unable to back
out.
Schwartz then moved forward a bit and tried
to turn around, thinking it might be easier to go
through the constriction head-first. At 5:50

Ar - rock fall
On Labor Day weekend, a group of four cav-
ers obtained a permit and visited Endless Cave
in the Guadalupe Mountains of southeast New
Mexico. At one point, a large rock David Ander-
son was using as a handhold came loose and fell,
hitting him on the left leg. It apparently was
quite heavy and pointed where it struck him. He
suffered a puncture wound that apparently went
clear to the bone, possibly chipping the tibia.
Companions left and called the Carlsbad Police
Department and New Mexico State Police.
BLM rescue resources arrived on their own and
got authorized. As it turned out this was fortu-
nate as all the manpower was needed to evacuate
the victim.

Ace - caver fall
On Sunday, September 8, a group of four or
five experienced cavers visited Trenton Well
near Trenton, Alabama. They rigged the 218
foot pit with a new rope, and Chris Pratt fed the
rope through his rack, ready to go down. Unfor-
tunately, he only used four of the hollow steel
bars, and as soon as he went over the edge, he
was falling, out of control. He grabbed the rope
with his left hand and got a wrap around one leg
to provide more friction.
About 15 or 20 feet from the bottom, his hel-
met, a Petzl Ecrin, caught on an overhang. It was
reportedly knocked askew and then off. He
landed upright, suffering a compression fracture
to his left leg and rope burns on his right knee.
Some of his companions came down and per-
formed basic first aid and put him in a sleeping
bag to prevent hypothermia. One at least made
the several mile hike down the mountainside
and drove to a phone to call 911.
There was a good response to the call-out, and
Pratt was hauled from the pit and taken by heli-
copter to a hospital in Huntsville.

October 13
Cc - caver fall
On Sunday, October 13, Steve Knutson, Bob
Richardson and Dr. Bill Brickle were scouting a
marble bench below the lip of hanging Sky High
Valley, adjacent to Marble Valley in northern
California, Richardson spotted a streambed
leading to a small entrance. Knutson told him it
had been checked before, but Richardson
crawled in anyway, and soon his voice came
back from the crawl within, saying there was a
pit.
This was not supposed to be there, so Knutson
crawled in and belly-crawled past an excited
Richardson, who opined that it would need a
rope. Knutson stuck his head over the edge and
was looking down into what he knew was virgin
passage. The drop was only 10-12 feet and
looked climbable. He stated as much and started
down, having to bridge out over the drop with
his upper body to get his legs and feet over the
edge. The ceiling was still very low. As he got
his legs down, he was supported at the narrow
lip only by his forearms, resting on the smooth,
sloping surface above the lip. Below the lip it
belled out. A point of rock a few feet down of-
fered a foothold and he got one foot on it and put
his weight on and started to move his body
down.
Suddenly his foot shot off the apparently slick
rock and he fell, landing on his lower back. He
was stunned for a moment and in some pain but
was uninjured. He was able to climb back up and
leave the cave under his own power but was suf-
ficiently bruised that he could not go caving for
several days, despite a week-long speleocamp in
progress.

At 11:30 p.m. on Thursday, October 17, an
accident occurred in Arctomys Cave in the Ca-

(see account for Arctomys Cave, October 17).
Chris Zimmerman stayed with the injured vic-
tim at about -400 meters while his other two
companions went out, one to go for help and the
other to get survival gear and return to the inci-
dent site. No one showed up. Zimmerman fi-
nally became chilled and he and the victim
agreed it would be better if he headed out rather
than becoming another victim. He did so, but
was having trouble with his light and was unfa-
miliar with the cave. Near the entrance is an area
of confusing passages where he became lost. He
was found at 9:30 a.m. on Saturday by the first
rescuers to enter the cave, and was escorted to
the surface shortly after. He was cold and
shaken but in good condition considering his 43
hour stay in a freezing, alpine cave.

Ach - caver fall, hypothermia
On Saturday, October 19, a large group of
around 12 cavers visited Sloan's Valley Cave
via the Garbage Pit Entrance. They were appar-
ently recreating in the mud and water at the Mud
Slide when one of the group, Nathan Smith, lost
control and fell hard enough to break an ankle.
The leader of the group started alternately help-
ing the victim hobble on one foot or carrying
him out of the cave, but became tired at the base
of Garbage Pit Hill and sent his daughter to get
some assistance. She went to the landowner's
house and got them to call 911, assuring them
that a stretcher evacuation was necessary. The
landowner was asked by the dispatcher to waitat
the road turnoff to direct rescuers, so she took
her video camera and entertained herself.
Soon to arrive were the police, sheriff's de-
partment, rescue squad, ambulances, and five
fire trucks, 22 vehicles in all. She then pro-
ceeded to the entrance where the leader of the
group told her the injury wasn't serious, and
with an inflatable splint Smith would be able to
walk up GP Hill by himself. Unfortunately the
rescue had assumed a life of its own.

Be - lack of light
On Sunday, October 27, A group of three cav-
ers (20s) entered the Minton Entrance of Sloan's
Valley Cave in Kentucky. They had a map of the
cave and headed via the Duckunder for the Big
Room to see some big passage. They had no hel-
mets, were dressed in flannel shirts and jeans,
and had only flashlights for light. At the Big
Room, these gave out and they were stranded.
The next day, they were reported overdue to 911
and a rescue was initiated.
Fortunately a local caver involved himself.
After talking with the father of one of the vic-
tims, he deduced the victims' destination in the
cave. With some difficulty he was able to steer
the official rescuers to the Big Room where the
lost cavers were indeed found, little the worse
for their 34 hour stay underground.

MYSTERY FALLS, TN
November 8
Be - equipment failure
On Friday, November 8, a group of cavers
visited Mystery Falls, a cave with a 281-footen-
trance pit in Hamilton County, Tennessee. They
were trained fire fighters or rescue personnel.
Doing the pit, which takes a stream, can be a wet
affair. Not long before they entered they were
twice warned of the difficulties of the pit.
A small dam and catchment basin exists to al-
low dry access to the pit. The group borrowed a
plug for the dam and used the "wet" rigging
point. The plug leaked and the drop was "quite
wet." A portion of the group went down and
back up without incident. The remaining three
then descended successfully.
The first of this group to try to go up was Scott
a firefighter whose only ascending expe-
rience had been on a rope and pulley in a fire sta-
tion. He was using a "Butt-Strap" style
ropewalker system. He got about 50 feet up
when his system quit working. He was unable to
change over and descend and was stranded. His
companions, both paramedics, were able to pull
the victim out of the waterfall using the rope, but
were unable to do more.
The situation was communicated to the top,
and the others went for help, quickly notifying
the Park Service. A rescue squad was called in at
7 p.m. They rigged the rope in place to an an-
chored rack and lowered the victim to the bot-
tom where he could be assisted by the two
paramedics. Two rescuers descended with
warm clothing, medical supplies and a thermos
of hot coffee. His sub-lingual temperature was
95 degrees F.

climb was very tiring but without further inci-

SOTANO DE LATEVIO,
SAN LUIS POTOSI,
MEXICO
November 26 B
Dc - caver fall
On Tuesday, November 26, a group of seven
cavers entered Sotano de Latevio in the Xilitla
area of San luis Potosi, Mexico. The cave as far
as they had explored was vertically oriented,
with a known pit series of 190, 19, 56, 19, 18 and
48 feet. They carried a lot of rope and pushed on,
down pits of 65, 58, 83, 26, 11, 47, 10 and 33
feet. At this point they dropped into a room with
incoming water flow. The rock was thinly bed-
ded and contained one- to three-inch chert inter-
beds which they had found to be quite crumbly.
A pit led on, appearing to be about 25 feet
with a ledge 11 feet down. The edge of the pit
was a suspicious chert ledge. A nine mm rope
was rigged to a small formation, some seven
inches high and two inches thick. John Stembel
put his rack on the rope and moved out to the
edge to find something additional to rig to. The
portion he was standing on suddenly collapsed
and he disappeared from view, swinging free
under the remainder of the chert ledge which
was extremely undercut. He rappeled to the
ledge below and the rope was rerigged.
The trip continued without further incident. It
was felt that having the rack on the rope instead
of a direct tieoff absorbed some of the shock and
load of the fall, allowing the little formation to
hold. The cave passages tended to be narrow and
a rescue would have been a huge undertaking

Cec - rappel
On Saturday, December 28, a group of eight
were on a trip to visit a new cave in the same
mine shaft as Mine Shaft Cave. Two rappeled
partway down the 280-foot shaft and got off in
the new passage. John Flacker got on rope next,
using only four bars. He also had a spacer be-
tween the first two bars, limiting their ability to
provide friction. One of the others saw this and
called to those below to put on a bottom belay.
When Flacker started down, there came "that
unmistakable high pitched whine" - the rappel
was out of control. The bottom belay was suc-
cessful, though Flacker fell 110 feet and
smashed into the wall of the passage when he
came to a stop. He was presumably bruised but
otherwise was uninjured.
Reference:
Wayne Bodily "Hell Yes, They're Free
Aren't They" The Utah Caver, (3)6, December,
1991, pp 143-144.
Analysis:
This appears to be a "D" where the incident
involves no aid or injury, and I class other nor-
mally-belayed falls as such. Indeed, Bodily was
critical of having to ask twice for a bottom belay
for Flacker. Still, I feel a bottom belay should
not be considered standard practice since itoften
will expose the belayer to rockfall danger, so I
classed this as a "C." I think any caver who re-
quests a bottom belay before starting a rappel
should not go down, but should exit the cave and
get his/her gear and techniques in order.
Bodily recommends putting on more bars
than you think you'l need - you can always
take one off. Once out of control, any solution is
difficult for the victim. Flacker says he jammed
the bars together and just kept accelerating. One
should try to sit back on the rack before going
over the edge, to check the friction, but some-
times the rigging of the rope doesn't allow this.

On Saturday, February 9, a group of three cavers visited Saddle Butte
in the Coast Range of Oregon, to practice long rappels. The west face of
the butte is a steep, 500+ foot drop and a trail leads to the summit. A 400
foot rope was rigged and Mike Loomis rappelled down, soon disappear-
ing over the curve of the slope. The idea was to be deliberately short-roped
and practice the necessary change-over. Unfortunately, when Loomis got
near the end of the rope and stopped to change-over, he found he had left
his ascending gear at the top. Still, he had a safety Jumar and slid that
along as he free-climbed the face. At sections too sheer to climb, he con-
tinued using a leg-wrap as a second ascender.

bars. At the same time she stumbled on the rope pads at the edge and went
over the edge. The rack now gave almost no friction and she was in a near
free-fall. She froze and did nothing to stop the fall. The victim struck a
ledge partway down and then the bottom, a fall of over 100 feet. She suf-
fered broken foot and ankle, dislocated toes, three fractured vertebrae and
bruised ribs and sternum. She was transported by foot, vehicle and heli-
copter to a hospital.

Analysis:
The drowned divers were found with their
face masks off, tangled in the line with a good
supply of air in their tanks. The air was analyzed
and contained no carbon monoxide. In trying to
administer CPR and later by hospital personnel,
it was noticed that Nadich's windpipe was swol-
len shut. Nadich had a history of occasional
asthma attacks. Saunders consulted a doctor of
sports medicine who had treated a swimmer
whose asthma attacks were brought on by cold
water. Thus it is supposed that the cold water
precipitated an attack which was interpreted by
Molter and maybe Nadich as well as an equip-
ment failure. They apparently got together to
buddy-breathe and became tangled when
Nadich went into spasms of suffocation.
Saunders points you have respiratory
problems, you should not be cave diving.
SPOUT CAVE, WV
June
DI - silting
In late June, a two-man diving team, Bob
Flenner and Dave Chaney, continued explora-
tion in the Spout-Hanna Cave System in West
Virginia. They had been working on this for
some 16 months, gradually uncovering a com-
plex underwater area. On this trip, they found
the visibility to be six feet. A light was placed at
the start and they proceeded through known pas-
sage. The objective was a small lead that seemed
to be headed for Hanna Cave.
They entered the lead and saw silt stir. By the
time they were both well into the passage, visi-
bility was zero. They moved a little further and
things cleared a bit, again giving six-foot visibil-
ity. Cheney, coming last, suddenly discovered
he was fouled in the guide line, and signalled
with his light that he had a problem. Flenner
turned around and helped him untangle the line.
In looking back the way they had come, he could
see a cloud of zero visibility slowly following.
They looked at each other and simultaneously
signalled to abort the dive. As they turned to go,
visibility dropped to one-foot, then zero.
They proceeded by feel - lights now had no
effect. As Flenner, now last, neared the exit
hole, he ran into solid rock. No hole, just wall, all
around the line. Cheney was out but stayed at the
hole, shining his light back toward Flenner.
Flenner realized the line must have got into a fis-

trance. Immediately it was apparent that the visi-
bility had decreased. The floor was already ob-
scured by clouds of silt but the line was still in
clear water. The further they went the worse it
got. Finally, they had to stop using the DPV and
swam, keeping line contact. When they got to
about where the Squaw's Restriction should be,
the line disappeared into the sand on the floor.
They continued, pulling the line out of the sand
as they went, but soon reached a point where it
was too deeply buried. Visibility was down to a
foot or less. Gavin heard Turner shout into his
regulator, "What's this?"
They backed out of the low area and removed
their stage bottles and scooters. At that time the
second bottle that Gavin had been using ran out,
and he switched back to his doubles which still
had about 2,000 psig. There were two parallel
lines in this part of the cave, and they soon found
that the other disappeared into the sand as well.
Gavin secured the end of the reel line they
were carrying to the main line where it went into
the sand and tried to search for the way out. The
restriction ahead seemed completely blocked by
sand and perhaps rock, but visibility was so poor
that they were no longer sure of their location.
There was flow but there seemed no way
through. Gavin began to think they must have
made a wrong turn. While Turner continued to
search the restriction, Gavin retreated back into
the cave for 300 feet and again came to the up-
stream/downstream junction. They had gone the
right way. He returned to where they had
stashed their scooters and bottles and met
Turner there.
They tried for another 45 minutes to follow
the buried line, to no avail. At one point Turner
pointed to his pressure gauge it showed 400
psig. On his slate he wrote, "What do we do?"
Gavin had no miracle ideas and replied, "Hold
on I'll go look." He searched ahead yet again
using the reel line, sweeping left and right, but
again finding no passage.
After five minutes he returned to the cache but
Turner was not there. Gavin took his second
stage bottle, found it still had 600 psig, and be-
gan using that. What could he do? As he tried to
think of something that would save the day, that
bottle ran out he switched back to his doubles.
These now had less than 300 psig. He decided to
have one last attempt.
He soon found another line that had been
"T'd" into the main line. Where did this come
from? He followed it and came to a point where
the cave seemed to open up and saw something
hangng down, at the edge of his vision. He went
over and found it was the second stage of a scuba
regulator. As he passed, with his tanks almost
empty and his regulator beginning to offer resis-
tance to breathing, his manifold caught on the
hanging regulator and he rolled to free it. This
made him look up and he saw the permanent line
go up steeply. He suddenly realized he had
cleared the restriction and knew where he was.
He raced to the decompression bottles, hung at
100 foot depth, and immediately made use of
one, there being essentially no air in his tanks at
that point.
As he decompressed, he realized that Turner
must have drowned. The regulator that had

American Caving Accidents
Analysis:
It is assumed Turner found he could not wait
for Gavin, T'd in his reel line and, dragging his
tanks, made his way through the restriction. In
so doing, he made the opening large enough for
Gavin to pass through later with his tanks on.
Turner must have run out of gas just short of the
decompression tanks. When he lost conscious-
ness, he let go of the tanks and floated to the ceil-
ing. His tanks then fell, landing on the main line,
and stayed there. These final acts are miracu-
lously what just barely allowed Gavin to reach
the decompression tanks and live

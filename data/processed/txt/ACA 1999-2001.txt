An Overview of the 1999, 2000, and 2001 Reports
Following the example of previous issues of American
Caving Accidents (ACA), the reports have been separated into
two general categories: regular caving and cave diving, and
then further classified by result or outcome and by causes and
contributing factors. The cave diving incidents are grouped
separately, and an overview is presented at the end of this
section. Once again, we have used the category "difficulty on
rope," to encompass such problems as becoming stuck at the
lip of a pit, clothing or hair caught in the rappel device,
jammed rappel safety, or simply becoming unable to ascend or
descend. Our intent is to better describe these situations, which
might otherwise be lumped under "stuck," "trapped/stranded,"
or perhaps "equipment problem."
In reporting the number of incidents versus NSS
membership totals, only incidents involving fatalities, injury,
or aid were included. The reader should also be aware that the
members of the National Speleological Society constitute only
a portion of the population of active cavers. Further, not all
incidents are reported to ACA. These numbers should not be
considered reliable indicators of accident rates for caving, or
used to draw conclusions about the relative degree of risk or
danger involved in caving.
Incident Results
Fatalities
In 1999 there were four incidents resulting in fatalities. Hal
Bufford died while on rope in Ellisons Cave, Georgia,
possibly due to a combination of hypothermia and harness-
induced pathology. First-time caver Robert Canady died,
apparently from suffocation, when he became stuck in a tight
passage in Hermit Cave, Oklahoma. Francis Reyes, an
experienced caver and NCRC instructor who was working as a
commercial cave guide, was killed in Cueva Los Angeles,
Puerto Rico, when he was swept away as the cave flooded.
NSS member Christy Quintana was killed in Sotano del Aire,
Mexico, after being struck by rockfall while on rope in the
764-foot entrance pit.
There were two fatal incidents in 2000. Paul Snowburg
was killed when he apparently slipped and fell into the 150-
foot entrance pit at Birds Drop, Virginia. NSS member Joe Ivy
died in O-9 Well, Texas, when he fell during a bolt-climb and
his belay system failed.
In 2001 there were five fatalities. Aaron Standage drowned
in Redman Cave, Arizona, while attempting to free-dive a
sumped passage. Jeffrey Young died in Earthquake 90 Cave,
Tennessee, when he either fell or jumped into a 70-foot pit in
the cave. NSS member Sharn Cleland was trapped by rockfall
in an unnamed cave in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and
died when the passage collapsed in spite of rescue efforts. A
23-year-old male caver collapsed and died of an apparent heart
attack while exploring Bowden Cave, West Virginia. Dr. John
Miller collapsed and died, also of a heart attack, while
exploring Tumbling Rock Cave, Alabama.
Injury and Aid
Incidents in this category resulted in injury to one or more
people, who then required help in order to exit the cave. While
many of these incidents involved rescue call-outs and outside
assistance, others were resolved by the cavers themselves
without calling for rescue.
In 1999 there were 14 incidents involving injury and aid.
Twelve of these resulted from caver falls. Intoxication was
reported as a factor in several of these incidents. Notable
incidents included two rescues of fallen cavers from Tongue
River Cave, Wyoming, a caver who exited Cave Mountain
Cave, West Virginia, with the help of his companions after
breaking his leg in a fall, and the successful six-day, multi-
national rescue of a Canadian caver who fell and was injured
at -300 meters in Sistema Tepepa, Mexico.
There were 20 reported incidents in 2000 in which injured
cavers required assistance. Fourteen of the incidents involved
caver falls. Other causes included rockfall, cuts on sharp
rocks, becoming stuck in crevices, hypothermia subsequent to
becoming lost and stranded, and bad air. Notable incidents
included two more fallen-caver rescues in Tongue River Cave.
Wyoming, the self-rescue of a caver who fell and broke his leg
in O-9 Well, Texas, several instances of cavers who dislocated
their shoulders but were able to exit with help from their
companions, and the rescue of two inexperienced cavers who
stranded themselves in a pool in Snail Shell Cave, Tennessee,
and developed hypothermia.
For 2001 there were 10 reported incidents involving injury
and aid. Eight of these were due to caver falls, one involved a
caver who dislocated his shoulder on a climb, and one was due
to rockfall entrapment. Notable incidents included the rescue
of an experienced caver who was injured in a fall in Sides
Cave, Kentucky, a caver who fell down a 133-foot pit when

her rappel rack became detached from her seat harness, and
the rescue of a Mexican caver who fell when his descending
system failed deep in Resumidero La Joya, Mexico.
Aid, No Injury
Most incidents in this category are rescues of individuals
that cavers often refer to as "spelunkers." They are typically
poorly equipped and inexperienced, and are often stranded
when they break or lose their flashlights, run out of batteries,
descend pits hand-over-hand, or get lost.
In 1999 there were 18 incidents in which uninjured cavers
required assistance. Three of these involved cavers who
simply became lost. Three others involved inexperienced
cavers who became stuck in tight passages. Two involved
cavers without proper vertical equipment who became
stranded in pits. One incident involved a caver who became
stranded on rope in a waterfall, and two others involved cavers
trapped by flooding. Notable incidents include the 49-hour
flood-entrapment of nine cavers in Hurricane Ridge Cave,
West Virginia, a group lost in Organ Cave, West Virginia, for
seven hours, the flood-entrapment of 35 students in Cueva
Chorreadero, Mexico, and a group of cavers stranded at the
bottom of Fantastic Pit in Ellisons Cave, Georgia, when a
caver inadvertently pulled up their rope.
There were 15 incidents in 2000, comprised primarily of
cavers who became lost, stranded, or stuck in caves. Notable
incidents included the flood entrapment of cavers in Cass
Cave, West Virginia, the rescue of four stranded teens from
the bottom of a 30-foot pit in W-Road Cave, Tennessee, on
Easter Sunday, a caver who fell from a cable ladder while
climbing unbelayed in Fieldhouse Cave, West Virginia, a
group of rock-climbers who became stranded in Wind-Ice
Cave, Wyoming when they lost their way while attempting a
pull-down through-trip, and a tourist who was left behind by
his group while on a guided tour of Mammoth Cave,
Kentucky.
For 2001 there were 13 reported incidents involving aid
but no injury. Five of these were cavers who became stuck in
tight passages or crevices, and three involved cavers who
became stranded in pits due to lack of equipment or
inexperience. One caver became stranded on rope due to
exhaustion and had to be rescued, and one incident involved
flooding.
Notable incidents for 2001 included an exhausted and
stranded caver rescued from Carpenter-Swago Pit, West
Virginia, by her companions (who had the skills and
equipment to rig and use a 3:1 Z-rig haul system), the 39-hour
flood entrapment of a group of Boy Scouts in Bowden Cave,
West Virginia, and the rescue of a 16-year-old boy who
became stuck in a crevice in Skunk Cave, Iowa. Sharing
vertical gear at pits by passing it up and down the rope is very
poor practice, but some people continue to do it, with
predictable results. Incidents at Cass Cave, West Virginia and
Pinnacles Cave, Nevada, illustrate the consequences.
Injury, No Aid
These incidents resulted in injuries ranging from scrapes
and bruises to sprained ankles and broken legs. In each case,
the victim was able to exit the cave with minimal assistance
from members of the caving party. There were eight incidents
in this category in 1999. One involved a caver who was struck
by a crowbar while working on a dig. The others were all
caver falls. Of the three incidents in 2000, two were cases of
histoplasmosis contracted by visitors to Climax Cave,
Georgia, and Cueva Alfredo Jahn, Venezuela. The other was
an injury due to a tossed cyalume stick at a party in a cave.
Five incidents were reported in 2001, including a twisted
ankle, a case of frostbite, a caver fall, a rockfall incident, and a
caver who made a grueling self-rescue after breaking her
lower leg in a fall in Sistema Purificacion, Mexico. When
circumstances permit, getting out of the cave on your own or
with the help of your companions is usually a good idea.
No Consequence
Many of these incidents are of the "near miss" category.
They are included SO that the reader will be aware of the many
things that can go wrong. Some of these offer good
illustrations of effective self-rescue or small-group rescue. The
three incidents reported in 1999 included a near-miss at Devils
Pocket Cave, Alabama, when a rig point collapsed while a
caver was on rope, and a caver who became stuck in the Gun
Barrel in Knox Cave, New York. There was one reported
incident for 2000 involving a near-miss with rockfall in
Nielsons Cave, Utah. The two reported incidents for 2001 both
occurred in Lost Creek Siphon, Montana, where a caver
experienced difficulty on rope when his Croll chest ascender
became detached while climbing, then suffered a fall on a later
trip when the passage floor collapsed beneath him.
Incident Types
Acetelyne Hazard or Explosion
No acetylene-related incidents were reported for 1999-
2001. This may be due to the increasing use of electric lights.
Bad Air
An 18-year-old man was rescued from Sulfur Cave,
Colorado, in September of 2000 when he lost consciousness in
the entrance room due to bad air. Bad air was also cited as a
factor in incidents at Hermit Cave, Oklahoma (April, 1999),
Boy Scout Cave, Florida (December, 1999), and Climax Cave,
Georgia (April, 2000). For a discussion of bad air in caves see
Bill Mixon's article in the April 2000 ACA and Bill Elliott's
article in December 1997 ACA.
Caver Fall
Falls remain the leading type of safety incident or accident
in caving, accounting for the majority of injuries and rescues.
Many of the incidents could have been prevented by the use of
a simple belay. Cavers should consider using a belay
whenever the exposure of a climb or traverse is greater than a
body-length. A belay should always be used with a cable
ladder, as illustrated by the June, 2000 incident at Fieldhouse
Cave, West Virginia.
Drowning
Drowning incidents are infrequent in "dry caving," but two
are reported in this issue. The 1999 death of Francis Reyes in
Los Angeles Cave, Puerto Rico, during a flood has been
mentioned above, as has the death of a would-be sump diver
in Redman Cave, Arizona in 2001. There was also a near-miss
incident in the summer of 1999 in Dead Mans Cave, Texas.
Equipment Problem
This catch-all category includes rigging failures, slipping
ascenders, light failure, rope failure, and misuse or lack of
equipment.

Flooding
There were six incidents involving flooding, including four
in 1999 and one each in 2000 and 2001. Several involved
experienced cavers who believed that their knowledge of the
cave or the weather would keep them safe. This is apparently a
common fallacy; such beliefs have been advanced by the
victims of almost every flooding incident reported in ACA
since 1993. Some of the trapped cavers entered caves that
were known to flood or had been the scene of previous well-
known flooding incidents in spite of inclement weather or
questionable forecasts.
The lesson taught by these incidents is simple: pay
attention to the weather conditions. Check the forecast for the
caving area, and be alert for the possibility of flooding. If the
cave is known to flood and you don't have a clear forecast, go
somewhere else. It's just not worth the risk of entrapment,
rescue, media attention, closed caves, injury, or death.
Hypothermia
Hypothermia is usually a secondary result in the reported
incidents, occurring subsequent to cavers becoming injured,
stranded, or trapped in a cave. There were several incidents
involving lost or stranded cavers in which some of those
rescued required hospitalization and treatment for
hypothermia. Remember: hypothermia can kill you all by
itself, but it also impairs your brain, which makes it easier to
make bigger mistakes.
Illness
There were two incidents of histoplasmosis reported in
2000, and two fatal heart attacks while caving in 2001.
Lost
Most of these incidents involved untrained and ill-
equipped cavers with little experience. Many escalate to the
"stranded" category when the batteries run out. Several of
these incidents also involved hypothermia, with a few cases
resulting in hospitalization.
Rockfall
Rockfall remains a serious source of accidents and
incidents, causing several injuries and rescues as well as cases
of entrapment. The most serious rockfall incidents reported
during this period were the death of Christy Quintana in
Sotano del Aire and the death of Sharn Cleland in an unnamed
Pennsylvania cave. Quintana was struck by falling rocks while
on rope in a deep pit in a remote backcountry location.
Cleland was trapped by and later died as a result of breakdown
collapse while exploring a new cave.
Stuck
Despite popular perception, getting stuck is not much of a
hazard in caving. Most victims are inexperienced cavers who
just need a little coaching and assistance from their
companions. Utah's Nutty Putty Cave is notorious in this
respect and was the scene of three of the incidents included in
this report. In some cases, however, becoming stuck can be
quite serious, as shown by the April, 1999 fatality at Hermit
Cave, Oklahoma, the two incidents in 1999 at Knox Cave,
New York, and incidents in 2001 at Skunk Cave, Iowa, and
Gage Caverns, New York.
Trapped/Stranded
This category is used to describe incidents in which the
caver or cavers are prevented from exiting the cave by
rockfall, light failure, lack of equipment, equipment failure, or
other causes. In many of the reported incidents, "spelunkers"
became stranded due to inexperience, inadequate equipment
and/or poor judgment.
There were 17 reported incidents of this type in 1999,
including incidents in Pettijohns Cave, Georgia, New River
Cave, Virginia, King Blair Cave, Indiana, Bowden Cave, West
Virginia, and Clarksville Cave, New York. The 14 incidents
reported for 2000 occurred in caves including Queen Blair
Cave, Indiana, Grassy Cove Saltpeter Cave, Tennessee, Indian
Grave Point Cave, Tennessee, Wind-Ice Cave, Wyoming,
Snail Shell Cave, Tennessee, and Jennings Cave, Florida. The
nine incidents reported for 2001 included Cass Cave, West
Virginia, My Cave, West Virginia, Pinnacles Cave, Nevada,
John Browns Cave, West Virginia, Pettijohns Cave, Georgia,
and Carpenter-Swago Cave, West Virginia. Long-time readers
of ACA will no doubt recognize many of these caves from
previous reports.
Exhaustion
Several incidents involved cavers who became exhausted
while climbing, either on rope or on cable ladders. This type
of incident is potentially fatal due to the rapid onset of
harness-induced pathology (also known as "harness-hang
syndrome" or "suspension trauma"). Studies have shown that
an immobile caver hanging on rope can lose consciousness in
a matter of minutes, with death occurring soon after. Several
articles on the subject are now available on the Internet and
can be found with any search engine. A 2002 report prepared
by Paul Seddon for the British Health and Safety Executive
provides the most comprehensive review of research and
literature on the subject published to date.1 An exhausted or
hypothermic caver left suspended will die in a matter of
minutes after losing consciousness. Learn how to get yourself
or another caver off rope with a change-over or pick-off.
Difficulty on Rope or Ladder
This category includes cavers who become stranded on
rope and require assistance, or who experience significant
difficulties and require assistance to complete their ascent or
descent. There were four incidents of this type in 1999, three
in 2000, and one in 2001. The March 1999 incident in Ellisons
Cave, Georgia, resulting in the death of Hal Bufford was the
most serious incident, and serves as a warning to all of us.
Some of the cavers involved in these incidents were
relatively inexperienced and did not know how to use their
gear. Others were experienced cavers who were simply out of
practice or out of shape. Some were unable to deal with
situations such as crossing the lip of a pit with weight on the
rope from below, changing from rappel to ascent and vice
versa, or climbing a cable ladder. It should go without saying
that competent cavers master their systems and know how
their equipment works. With practice, skilled cavers can
perform a change-over in less than 60 seconds. Spend some
time practicing-it could save your life.
Other
This catch-all category includes driving your snowmobile
into a pit, getting hit with a tool during a dig, cuts by sharp
rocks, dislocated shoulders, being struck by thrown objects,
twisted ankles, and other incidents not covered above.

Cave Diving Incidents
In the three-year period from January 1999 to December
2001, there were 24 reported incidents resulting in 26
fatalities, two rescues, and one case of decompression
sickness. Two of the incidents resulted in multiple fatalities.
While many of the reported incidents involved non-certified
divers who failed to use proper equipment or follow accepted
safety practices, there were several fatalities involving well-
equipped, certified cave divers with many years of experience.
In 1999 there were seven reported cave diving incidents,
all of which occurred in Florida. Four resulted in single
fatalities, and one resulted in the death of two divers. Jason
Richards was rescued from Wakulla Springs by fellow divers
when he lost consciousness during a dive after breathing from
the wrong gas bottle for his depth. Henry Kendall died of
unknown causes while diving alone in the entrance pool of
Wakulla Springs. Steven Wixon died during a dive in Jackson
Blue Spring after becoming separated from his diving partners
and losing visibility due to siltation. Guido Gaudenzi died in
Diepolder Spring when he lost consciousness during the dive
after breathing from the wrong gas bottle for his depth. A
diver was rescued from Thunderhole after becoming stranded
in an air pocket when she entered the wrong passage in the
entrance pool. Richard Siaba and Kevin Lynn died in Madison
Blue Spring after apparently losing their guideline during a
dive. A male diver drowned at Forty Fathom Grotto during a
cavern dive to a depth of 237 feet.
There were eight reported cave diving incidents in 2000,
including six incidents resulting in single fatalities, one
multiple fatality incident in which four divers perished, and
one non-fatal incident involving decompression sickness.
Michael Hickey died in Little River Spring, Florida, when he
apparently lost the route after silting the water. Jill Heinerth
suffered decompression sickness after a dive in Cenote Dos
Ojos, Mexico. Stephen Turner died during a solo dive in Little
River Spring, Florida. Jorge Luis, Lin Enrique, Israel Garcia,
and Roberto Lagart died in Pozo de Juan Claro, Cuba, when
they apparently became lost and ran out of air. Rafael
Mendiburu, President of one of the leading cave diving
organizations in Mexico, died from a heart attack while diving
in Cenote Sabak Ha. Paul Hayden died when he breathed from

In 2001 there were nine reported cave diving incidents, all
resulting in fatalities. Mark Granger and William Ridenour
died in Royal Springs, Florida, after running out of air. Robert
Svensson died in Clarksville Cave, New York, when he
became stuck while trying to dive a sumped passage. Ron
Fraga died in Cenote Escondido, Mexico, after running out of
air during his dive. A solo diver failed to return from his dive
in Andros Blue Hole, Bahamas, and was presumed drowned.
Jason Burns drowned in Emerald Sink, Florida, when he
became separated from his companions during a dive and
could not find his way out of the cave. Steve Berman died in
Devils Ear Spring, Florida, after apparently running out of air
during his dive. Christopher Hill died in Ginnie Springs,
Florida, while diving alone without equipment. Dr. Ruben
Delgado was presumed drowned when he disappeared during
a dive in Great Blue Hole, Belize. Jonathan Gol died after
losing consciousness during decompression following a dive
in Jackson Blue Spring, Florida.
Caving-related Incidents
Once again we have a curious assortment of caving-related
incidents, including crime victims and missing persons found
in caves, animal rescues, people falling into sinkholes and
mine shafts, and another snowmobile incident. In 1999 the
body of a murder victim was found in Lost Creek Cave,
Tennessee and a man reported as missing was found in an
Ohio cave hiding from an anticipated meteor strike. The year
2000 featured the rescue of a stranded calf, a wasp attack at a
cave, a kidnapping victim left in an Alabama cave, a fatal fall
into a mine shaft, a person who drowned after being swept
into a cave entrance, several incidents involving drug or
alcohol intoxication at caves, and a snowmobile driven into a
pit. In 2001 a woman died after becoming wedged head-down
in an opening into a lava tube while trying to retrieve some
lost puppies.

Water Caves
George Dasher
Water caves are the most dangerous type of cave any caver
will ever encounter. While maps, guidebooks, and the
ever-present speleo-rumor mill can provide valuable hints
about the nature of a water cave and any high hideaways
located within, these are not substitutes for common sense.
There are two items to look for to determine if a cave is a
water cave: Does the cave have a stream flowing into its
entrance, or is there a stream inside the cave? Since almost all
of North America's caves were formed by water, virtually all
of these caves are either active or paleo water caves. An
"active" water cave is a cave with flowing water inside, or
where flood waters can rise and enter the cave-either through
the entrance or via a subterranean conduit.
Once we have determined that the cave is a water cave, we
need to ask ourselves the following:
How big is the stream compared to the size of the
cave's passages?
Does the stream flow into or out of the entrance?
Is there a surface overflow route for the stream to
circumvent the cave?
How big is the drainage basin above the cave?
What is the current local weather forecast? (This is
extremely important!)
I want to keep things concise and easy to remember. There
are four factors which may cause high water. These are:
Heavy rains
A light rain when the ground is already saturated
Any kind of rain after a drought (the ground has
formed a crust and the water will run into the cave, not
soak into the ground)
Snow melt (In fact, the worst of the sudden high-water
bad boys is rainfall onto snow)
The type of soil cover is also important-rainfall onto
limestone bedrock or frozen ground is going to flow into a
cave faster than rainfall onto thick topsoil. Also, a winter rain
may flood a cave faster than a summer rain, as the lush
summer vegetation can absorb or slow groundwater flow.
I will use Cass Cave, a very famous vertical cave in
Pocahontas County, West Virginia, as an example. It has been
the site of numerous rescues and near-rescues, and I am sure
many people think most of these incidents have been vertical
in nature. They were not. Since the invention of kernmantle
rope, there have been five reported incidents in Cass. Of these,
only one was a vertical accident, when a novice caver did his
first-ever rappel from the 160-foot high Belay Loft. It did not
go well.
The other four documented incidents include two parties
who were trapped by high water just inside the entrance and
two persons who died on rope in the exact same place on the
Suicide Falls drop. Although one of the persons killed was a
novice caver, the two did not die from vertical mistakes. They
died because they underestimated the dangers presented by
water-in short, they both got on rope in water and died of
hypothermia. I was on the second body recovery, and this is
why I use Cass for my example. I am certain that the caving
community is not seeing Cass for the dangerous water cave it
can be. They are concentrating instead on the vertical aspect of
the cave. But Cass Cave aside, this same "should we enter the
cave today?" formula can be applied to any water cave.
First, a surface stream does flow into Cass Cave. It is a
perennial stream, flowing all the time. That's a mark against
going into the cave. Second, given the size of the cave
passages inside, this stream is a fairly large stream. The cave
becomes a crawlway several hundred feet inside, SO the
possibility of the cave flooding to the ceiling is very real.
That's a second mark against going into the cave.
Third, while there is a surface overflow route that
circumvents the cave, this overland route does not often flow.
Put another way, the cave takes a large amount of water before
the stream overflows onto the surface. This is bad news for
any caving party underground on a wet day. So this is a third
mark against going underground.
Fourth, there is a sizeable drainage basin above the cave-
just look up the mountain! Or consult a topographic map
before the caving trip. This is a fourth mark against going
underground in Cass.
Fifth This is the variable a caving party can control. If
the weather people are calling for severe rain, then don't go
into the cave. If there is no forecast of rain, then a caving trip
is possible. If the forecast is for light or intermittent rain, then
you have to use your own judgment. So, the bottom line is-
with four marks against going underground in Cass Cave-
any caving party has to be very sure about the weather
forecast, as there is not a lot of leeway for error.
When it comes to water caves and you want to stay alive,
you only have one option: be on the surface when the high
water hits. This is especially true in caves with no high
hideaways. In other words, all caving trips have abort factors,
and not aborting can mean your death. I've seen only one flood
underground, and it was literally an instantaneous wall of
water. Since there had been no forecast of rain and we were
not in a perennial stream passage, this perplexed the two of us
on the trip; however, there was nothing we could do but abort
our trip and be thankful that the high water hadn't hit us in the
crawlway we were planning to survey.
Two other things: It always helps to have local knowledge
of your caving area. Make an effort to do this. Talk to people;
do the library thing. This is what separates a good trip leader
from your run-of-the-mill caver. For example: The name of
the stream flowing into Cass Cave is Cold Run, and it is
named that for a reason. It is a high-altitude mountain stream,
and it is cold!
And the last thing: Do not get on rope in water if you are
not dressed to handle the cold, and don't rappel into deep
water without some kind of flotation gear. If the drop is wet,
you have to be dressed for this before you get on rope. If the
passage below is in flood, or if the water there is unexpected,
be prepared to change over on rope and head for sunshine. Be
a rescuer, not someone requiring a rescue or a dead someone
requiring a body recovery.

Lightning Safety for Cavers
John Gookin
Numerous cavers have been shocked by lightning. The
serious injuries have been near cave entrances, especially
when metal cables, cable ladders, and wires were being used.
Cavers walking on the surface, to and from caves, are
generally at greater lightning risk than they are while caving.
In general, it is much safer to be well inside a cave than on the
surface during an electrical storm. But some cave entrance
areas appear to be even more dangerous than other places on
the surface.
One proviso: Non-cavers often call small overhangs
"caves." Small overhangs are especially dangerous. Lightning
tends to flash over surfaces, and it easily jumps the gaps of
these small pseudo-caves, especially when rain water is
running. Humans offer better paths for conducting electricity
across those gaps. Be sure to tell non-cavers that cave
entrances are dangerous during electrical storms, SO they will
get the message that these "caves" are poor places to be in a
thunderstorm. Real cavers who are underground probably
won't even know that a thunderstorm is outside unless
someone gets shocked, the water level starts to rise from rain,
or they are exiting the cave and hear the thunder rumbling at
the entrance.
Cavers as far as a mile underground have been shocked by
lightning. 1 Those standing in water seem to get shocked more.
People standing in water on the surface have been shocked
through the water, at the same long distances from strikes.
Touching the cave ceiling while standing on the ground will
increase your potential to conduct current. But cavers well
within a cave don't seem to get more than uncomfortable (or
slightly debilitating) shocks. It's the cavers in the entrance pits,
on cable ladders, or near other metallic conductors, that tend
to get seriously hurt by lightning. Wet ropes hanging in an
entrance can be as dangerous as cables, but have only been
observed as lightning conductors in the mountaineering
accident data-not in caves, yet. Metal handrails into show-
caves need occasional gaps in the metal to avoid channeling
lightning strikes to everyone touching that railing in the cave.
These gaps should be feet long, not inches long, and the
railings should be well grounded near the surface. Plastic
bridges between railings should be in dry locations.
Do particular caves attract lightning?
Some caves definitely get struck more often than others.
This has been well documented in the Pyrenees 3 This
has
also
been documented via geomagnetic signatures in lava tubes.
But why some caves get struck more than others is open to
debate. If you don't care why some caves might get struck
more than others, skip to "lightning safety guidelines."
Caves tend to be exhaling highly conductive air in the
afternoons when lightning tends to strike. Diurnal cave
1 Personal correspondence from Mike Zawada regarding an incident in 1962.
2 Personal correspondence from Cindy Heazlit regarding an incident in 1999.
Choppy, J. "Caves Attract Lightning," Paris, 1994. See John Gookin for an
English translation.
Figure 1 - First, a leader moves down from the cloud in 50m
steps. When it is close to the ground, it attracts "streamers" from
the closest objects. Second, when the leader connects with the
closest streamer, the big "return stroke" travels along its path.
Caves would only tend to attract a strike if they had an elevated
conductor, like a tree or a column of ionized air, up high where
they would connect with more leaders.
breathing is well documented, but exhaled cave air flows
downhill and tends to stay together like a river of air-you can
feel it. The high conductivity of cave air was documented
decades ago. 4 This needs further examination by analyzing the
cave air itself for ions and by looking for electrical fields
above exhaling cave entrances.
Look at Dave Bunnell's photo of Wolf River Cave on page
12 to see an example of typical cave entrance air movement.
Cool dry air is seeping out of the cave below the fog layer.
Dry air is actually heavier than moist air: this is counter-
intuitive. And cool air is heavier than warm air. At the
thermocline between the cave air and the warm moist surface
air, fog forms when the cool cave air condenses the moisture
from the warm surface air. If a storm was approaching, the
dropping barometric pressure would suck huge amounts of
cool air out of the cave. A turbulent storm could mix the air
more. Some people who study caves and lightning think this
air helps attract lightning to caves that breathe a lot of air, but
others dismiss this theory as preposterous.
Another important factor to observe in this photo is that
the local stream is flowing from the cave. This is a wet spot in
the well-drained karst terrain. Diving or emerging streams are
excellent conduits for electrical charge to move in or out of the
Earth. This charge helps develop the "streamers" that blaze the
trail for a significant lightning strike, and it helps channel
ground current from a strike. Cavers have been standing in
water a mile underground, and been shocked through the
stream of water. Observers at the cave entrances have
documented incidents in which lightning repeatedly struck an
4 ibid.

---------- Page 14 ----------
Figure 2 - When lightning strikes, it creates powerful surface
arcs above the ground surface and ground currents under the
surface. Most victims are killed by ground currents. Any long
conductors, such as cables, wet ropes, metal handrails, or
streams, tend to channel that ground current as it travels into the
Earth. This factor may not make caves attract more direct lightning
strikes, but it may channel the energy of nearby strikes into more
caves.
entrance, shocking the cavers underneath 5 But other observers
at cave entrances have noticed that sometimes lightning hits
far from the entrance, and still shocks the cavers in the water
underneath. The distant strikes that shock cavers are probably
connecting to the cave stream via some other stream passage,
not via the same entrance the cavers used.
Dale Green is an amateur geophysicist who has been
studying lava tubes. While mapping the magnetic fields
around lava tubes in Idaho, he has found that the magnetic
disturbances caused by lightning strikes are concentrated
around entrances of tubes that blow air. These strikes can be
detected because intense currents from lightning magnetize the
lava and completely alter any previous magnetic field. Away
from entrances, lightning strikes were found to be very sparse
and randomly placed. The cause for this entrance
concentration is unknown, but may be due to moisture in the
exhaled air. If this seems like a weak scenario, consider that
the main location most houses receive direct lightning strikes
is through furnace exhaust vents.
We can actually start looking at real lightning strike data at
cave entrances in the lower 48 US States and much of Canada
from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). The
NLDN is run by Vaisala Global Atmospherics, Inc. (VGAI).
To see a real-time map of lightning in the US for the past two
hours, go to www.lightningstorm.com VGAI sells detailed
lightning data to anyone who wants it and they can produce
color-coded maps showing strike concentrations for specific
areas. If you get struck and want to know whether it was a hot
strike or a cool one (they can vary from 1-200kA) VGAI can
use your exact time and location to tell you more about "your"
strike. If you think a local cave is lightning prone, you can hire
them to tell you if that location is really a hot spot.
5 "An Electrifying Incident Beneath the Arbuckles," by R.D. Milhollin, NSS
News, May 2000.
Discussing theories of why some caves are more lightning
prone than others is an academic exercise that may eventually
help us predict relative risks in certain caves. But it is a fact
that some caves are more lightning-prone than others. When
the locals tell us that certain caves are lightning-prone, we
should be careful around these entrances by minimizing our
time of exposure during storms.
Lightning safety guidelines for cavers
Time your caving trips to avoid thunderstorms.
Avoid cave entrances during thunderstorms.
Avoid long conductors during thunderstorms.
Avoid water, and touching the wall or ceiling if near the
surface during a storm.
Drop into the lightning position (see below) if a lightning
hazard exists.
Additional lightning safety guidelines for people on the
surface
Seek a modern building, a car, or safer terrain if you hear
thunder.
Avoid high ground if you hear thunder.
Avoid relatively tall trees if you hear thunder.
The lightning position
Assume the lightning position6 when at risk. This will
reduce the chances of getting a direct strike and it may reduce
the other effects of lightning, but it offers no guarantees. Some
scientists argue that it barely helps protect you; others argue
that it is much more valuable because the data says that no one
in this position has ever been hurt. This position involves
squatting (or sitting) and balling up SO you are as low as
possible without getting prone. Wrap your arms around your
legs, both to offer a safer path than your torso for electrons to
flow from the ground, and to be comfortable enough to hold
the position for a longer time. Close your eyes.
While the prone position is lower, being spread out
increases the potential for ground current to flow through or

you have any insulated objects handy, like a foam pad or a soft
pack full of clothes, squat or sit on them. Avoid backpacks
with frames since the frame may concentrate ground current.
Don't touch metallic objects. Ground current may trigger your
leg muscles to jump while in the lightning position, SO take
care to avoid being near hazards when you drop into this
position. You won't get a warning that a strike is imminent
because the lightning event from cloud to ground and back
occurs faster than you can blink an eye, SO stay in the lightning
position until the storm passes.
The lightning position reduces the chances of lightning
injuring you as badly, but is no substitute for getting to safer
terrain or structure if it is immediately available. If you are
concerned enough to assume the lightning position, you
should have your group dispersed at least 50 feet apart to
reduce the chances of multiple injuries.
Summary
Cavers are probably at greatest risk from lightning while
walking to and from caves. But cave entrances offer
dangerous spots where we need to exercise a high level of
caution, moving past them quickly, just like when passing
under potential rockfall. Inside caves, we are only at moderate
risk when near the entrance or in the water. Deep in a cave and
on dry ground, we are probably safer than anywhere on the
surface.
These COWS made three fatal mistakes: 1) They were in an open area during a storm, exposing themselves to a direct strike. 2) They were near a long
conductor, which probably channeled high voltage down from a hillside strike. 3) They naturally had their legs spread far apart (about as far apart as a
person lying down), providing significantly more voltage to one leg than the others, which drove ground current in one leg and out the others.
Having said all of that, the leading experts in lightning
injury epidemiology say that lightning safety is about two-
thirds intelligent behavior and one-third luck. Following
lightning safety guidelines can eliminate two-thirds of the
lightning injuries in the world.
Cavers aren't just cavers: we are outdoors-people.
Knowing how to behave intelligently when lightning threatens
can help us in many other activities. Studying up on lightning
safety guidelines for other activities we participate in can help
us make more informed decisions wherever we are.

1999 Accident and Incident Reports


********** 17 January
Pettijohns Cave, Georgia
caver fall
Eric Shoemaker and companions were exploring in
Pettijohns Cave near the Signature Room. As Shoemaker
climbed down into the room, he looked down and saw what
appeared to be a hole that seemed to drop about five feet. He
started to climb down, but lost his grip and fell down the hole
and all the way to the bottom of the room, a distance of about
25 feet. He was bruised and stunned, but not seriously injured,
and was able to exit the cave with the assistance of his
companions.
Eric Shoemaker, Incident report, 20 January 1999.
Comments: Shoemaker reports that he was almost knocked
out by the fall, and that his helmet undoubtedly saved him
from serious head injury. He was also glad to have friends
with him to help. Pettijohns Cave is popular with all types of
cavers, many of whom are poorly equipped, lacking helmets
and other basic caving equipment.


********** 23 January
Diggins Pit, Alabama
stranded on rope
A caver rappelling into Diggins Pit in very wet conditions
decided to abort his descent and climb out due to the high
water volume. He stopped at a ledge about 40 feet down and
changed over to his ascending system. The ascender attached
to his seat harness used an adjustable-length sling employing a
prusik knot attached to the sling. When he put his weight on
the ascender, the prusik slipped and would not grip, making
the sling too long and preventing him from reaching the
ascender. He decided to change back to rappel and continue to
the bottom. He was unable to complete the procedure, decided
to cut some of the slings, and wound up stranded. He began to
develop hypothermia from the water falling down the drop.
His companion rappelled to the ledge and helped him get back
on rappel. Both cavers then rappelled to the bottom. The
stranded caver was then able to climb out on his own.
Buddy Lane, Personal communication, undated.
Comments: Vertical cavers should know their climbing
and rappelling systems intimately, and be capable of
performing a change-over with ease. Cavers who were not
able to do SO have died while hanging in waterfalls. Cutting
one's slings is seldom necessary or justified.


********** 23 January
Hurricane Ridge Cave, West Virginia
flood entrapment
Frank Abbato, Jeff Bray, Yvonne Droms, Tom Malabad,
Kristin Matak, Ed McCarthy, Dennis Melko, Phil Murray, and
Gary Vermillion entered Hurricane Ridge Cave on Saturday
morning for what was intended to be a six-hour photo trip.
The cave entrance is in a small sinkhole with an inflowing
stream and a tight vertical climb-down into the cave. The
weather forecast predicted rain in the area, but the cavers
believed that they could monitor the stream in the cave and
that they would be out before flooding could become a
problem. The cavers were dressed for cold, wet caving,
wearing wetsuits, balaclavas, and neoprene gloves.
The group entered without incident and began their
photography work, moving from the lower level water
passages into the dry upper regions of the cave. Bray became
ill and decided to leave the cave. He exited, accompanied by
Matak. When they reached the surface they found that it had
started raining.
The rain soon turned into a downpour, with several inches
of rain falling in about two hours. A flash flood developed,
turning the entrance sink into a whirlpool. When the seven
remaining cavers returned to the entrance after four hours,
they found it impassable. They retreated to the dry upper level,
where candles, a tarp, a sleeping pad, and other supplies had
been cached for use on survey trips. Using the tarp, some
plastic bags, and survival blankets carried by several of the
cavers, they fashioned heat tents, with their wetsuits,
coveralls, and the sleeping pad for insulation and the candles
for heat and light. The cavers huddled together, rotating the
outside people to the inside to warm up.
After the water crested and began to fall, the group made a
second attempt to exit. The tight passages and climbs at the
entrance remained impassable. They retreated to their camp
and settled down to wait, rationing their food and checking the
stream level every two hours.
After 33 hours in the cave, they made a third attempt to
exit. This time they we able to get within a few feet of the
entrance, where they found three plastic bottles containing
food and messages from rescuers waiting outside. The
messages included the time and date, a weather report, and
instructions to wait for rescuers to come get them. The
reassured cavers retreated to their camp, cold but in good
spirits, and waited for the water to subside.
After 49 hours in the cave, the trapped cavers were
relieved when five rescuers arrived at the makeshift camp on
Monday morning bearing food and heat packs. After warming
up, the cavers exited through a still-strong waterfall, reaching
the surface after 52 hours in the cave.

1999 Accident and Incident Reports
Comments: Bray and Matak exited at about 2:00 p.m.
Saturday afternoon. The entrance was found to be flooded at
about 3:30 p.m. Saturday. Since they knew the trapped cavers
were well prepared, Bray and Matak decided to wait to see if
the water would go down before calling for help. A group kept
vigil at the entrance through the afternoon and night, and again
on Sunday.
When the entrance was still flooded Sunday afternoon,
they notified Carroll Bassett, a local caver. Bassett and other
cavers came to the site to assist, but little could be done while
the entrance was flooded. Plastic bottles with food and
messages were dropped into the entrance at intervals in an
attempt to get supplies and information to the trapped cavers.
On Sunday afternoon, contact was made with the group in the
cave, but the entrance was still impassable. By Monday
morning, the water had gone down enough to allow a group to
enter and retrieve the stranded cavers. All were cold and tired,
but able to exit under their own power.
As Dasher notes, both the cavers and the rescuers were
experienced and took calm and appropriate actions. Rather
than rushing in or trying to put divers into the cave, they
wisely chose to wait for the water to subside. The trapped
cavers were appropriately dressed and equipped for wet
conditions, and the presence of the stored supplies made their
confinement safer and more comfortable. The use of candles
and a heat tent was helpful-even a plastic trash bag and a
candle or carbide lamp can be very effective against
hypothermia.
Bassett notes in his report that the "message in a bottle"
technique worked well, getting supplies and information to the
trapped group. He notes the importance of numbering the
messages and including the time and date, along with
information about the rescue efforts underway. Droms reports
that this was very reassuring to the stranded cavers. A lit
cyalume stick was included in each message bottle to increase
visibility, along with bright flagging tape attached to the
outside.
Bassett also advises, "If trapped by water, and people on
the surface know you are in the cave (and they should!), get to
high ground and keep warm. Those on the surface will come
for you as soon as it is safe. Trying to leave before may use up
valuable energy you may need to endure the wait and use to
leave under your own power."
Bray, Matak, and Droms report that the cavers were aware
of the forecast calling for rain on the day of the trip. Dasher
reports that the forecast called for heavy rains and that the
rains had been predicted for three days before the trip. He
suggests that "with this in mind, perhaps an alternative cave
should have been chosen." Droms states in her report, "We
should have known better, but people with our temperaments
make a habit of taking chances when we shouldn't," and notes
that Bray and Matak were somewhat reluctant to lead the trip
that day due to the weather report.
Dasher also notes, however, that the weather outside did
not appear threatening before the cavers entered, and that the
thunderstorm came up suddenly. A second storm later in the
day prolonged the entrapment by causing the cave to flood a
second time. He observes that "water is the most dangerous
thing we encounter underground."
Dasher and Droms note that the cavers felt that their
experience with the cave indicated that it would take at least
four hours for the stream to rise enough to create a problem,
and that they believed they could monitor the stream and exit
if necessary. Similar beliefs have also been advanced by
cavers in many other flood entrapment incidents reported in
American Caving Accidents. The reality is that no one can
predict the weather, the amount of rain that will fall in a given
period, or how long it will take a given cave to flood. Is it
really reasonable to gamble your life for a little rainy day
recreation?


********** 4 February
unspecified cave, Green Mountain, Alabama
stranded in pit, no equipment
Adam Faulk (13) and his friend Jonathan Graham,
accompanied by Adam's dog, set out to explore a cave that
Faulk had spotted on Green Mountain. Faulk brought along a
nylon rope for the pit entrance and a flashlight for the cave at
the bottom. When the boys reached the cave, Faulk descended
the 40-foot entrance pit hand-over-hand and explored a small
amount of cave at the bottom. As he tried to climb out, Faulk
dropped his flashlight and went back down to retrieve it. He
then found that he was unable to climb the nylon rope hand-
over-hand, and called for help. Graham ran back to Faulk's
house and told his parents, who called 911. The cave rescue
team responded, rigged the pit with a proper caving rope, and
sent a rescuer down with a helmet and a harness for Faulk,
who was then hauled out of the pit and returned to his waiting
parents.

learns lesson, Huntsville Times, 5 February 1999.
2. Unknown author, "Youngster who was stuck in cave is

Comments: Rescuers invited Faulk to join the Huntsville
Grotto. Faulk had read about a meeting of the club in the paper
the previous week and wanted to go, but his mother did not
allow it. He was reported to be looking forward to learning
how to cave safely.


********** 7 February
Paradise Cave, Colorado
fall from cable ladder
Bruce Albright was reported to have fallen from a cable
ladder in Paradise Cave, resulting in abrasions on his back and
scalp lacerations requiring six stitches.
Richard Rhinehart, "News and Notes About Caves and
Karst, "Rocky Mountain Caving, Spring 1999, p. 5.
Comments: No other information was available. One
wonders whether a belay was employed. Falls from ladders
can almost always be prevented by the use of a belay, which
should be standard procedure. Climbers can be belayed from
above or can be belayed from the bottom of the ladder using a
simple "slingshot" belay, in which the rope is doubled through
a carabiner rigged at the top of the climb. Self-belay systems
use a seat harness and a device rigged to slide up the rope
automatically as you climb. Regardless of the belay method, it
is essential to avoid developing any slack in the system.

1999 Accident and Incident Reports


********** 13 February
Organ Cave, West Virginia
lost
George Guntherie and his wife were celebrating their
anniversary and decided to take a guided tour of Organ Cave.
Guides Joyce Morgan and Shannon Morgan led them on a trip
to the Waterfall Room, a large room near the downstream end
of the Upper Stream Passage. On the way out, the group
missed a turn and wound up at a climb-down to the stream
level. Shannon Morgan (who was a novice caver and guide)
and George Guntherie climbed down to the stream, where they
encountered deep water. The women stayed at the upper level
and continued to the Dog Room, where they expected the men
to join them.
Unfortunately, the men headed in the wrong direction,
going downstream and deeper into the cave rather than
upstream toward the Dog Room. When they found themselves
in larger passage they realized that they were in unfamiliar
cave. Rather than returning the way they had come, they
continued ahead for about an hour before deciding that they
were lost. They returned to the point where they had first
noticed that they were in unfamiliar passage and waited for
rescue.
After waiting for some time in the Dog Room, the women
decided that the men must be lost, and left the cave to get help.
Joyce Morgan called local caver Bob Liebman, who brought
his visiting brother Bill Liebman to the cave. After calling
some more cavers familiar with the cave to come and help
search, the Liebman brothers entered the cave with Joyce
Morgan and went to the place where the missing men had last
been seen. Leaving notes at junctions, they began to search the
main passage along the stream and found the men's footprints
heading downstream. They soon found the lost cavers and
escorted them from the cave. The men had been lost for about
seven hours.

3. Bob and Bill Liebman, "Organ Cave Rescue," West
Virginia Caver, v17n2, April 1999, pp. 11-12.
Comments: Bill Liebman observes that the group made a
mistake by separating when they encountered the water. They
were already off-route at that point. However, once the two
men realized that they were lost, they returned to the point
where they had become lost, stayed put, and waited for
searchers to find them.
Organ Cave is a commercial cave offering "wild cave"
tours. Guntherie and his wife were first-time cavers and
paying customers. Liebman reports that the two guides did not
have any training in dealing with emergencies such as lost or
injured cavers, carried no emergency equipment such as
candles or plastic bags, were not familiar enough with the area
of the cave in which they were leading the trip, and did not
provide the customers with backup lights or other safety
equipment. He also noted that the cave operators did not have
an emergency plan or a list of names and contact numbers for
people familiar with the 37-mile long cave system. These
things were discussed with the cave operators.


********** 14 February
Jennings Cave, Florida
caver fall
Brian Williams, Dave Moore, and Jennifer Langford of the
Florida Speleological Society accompanied a group of five
Girl Scouts and four adult troop leaders on a trip to Jennings
Cave. The cave entrance is at the bottom of a 20-foot pit,
which the cavers planned to rappel and ascend. While
Williams briefed the scouts and their leaders on safety
procedures, Moore rigged a rope for the rappel and a cable
ladder for the ascent. All the cavers were properly equipped
with helmets, lights, and vertical gear.
Moore and Langford descended first. Two of the adult
leaders and all five of the scouts descended without incident,
with Williams providing assistance and instruction at the lip
and Moore providing a bottom belay.
Scout leader Mary Alice Petty (42) rigged in and began her
descent, backing toward the edge of the pit. As she
approached the lip, her feet slipped, and she fell forward and
struck her face against a rock outcrop beside the 3-foot wide
entrance. The impact resulted in multiple fractures of her jaw.
Williams called for a belay, and Moore held fast while
Williams rigged in on a separate line, checked Petty's injuries,
and helped her move away from the pit.
Williams then called for Moore and Langford to abort the
trip and get the scouts started out of the cave. Moore, an EMT,
came up first to tend to Petty, while Williams and Langford
assisted and belayed the others as they exited using the cable
ladder. All were out in about 30 minutes.
Once all the cavers were safely on the surface, Petty was
driven to a hospital for treatment, where she underwent
surgery to repair her fractured jaw.
Brian Williams, Incident report, undated.
Comments: Williams reports that Petty apparently slipped
in the loose dirt and leaves near the lip of the pit. None of the
others experienced any problem. The group was carefully
supervised and properly equipped, and made good use of the
bottom belay for rappel safety as well as belaying the cable
ladder climb.


********** 15 February
Lava Rise E-3 Cave, Hawaii
caver fall
While negotiating the entrance crawl, Ole Fulks dropped
his 5-cell flashlight. It rolled down into a dark area of the
entrance room, which is otherwise well-illuminated by light
coming through cracks in the ceiling. He crawled on into the
room, stood up, and walked down the rocky slope to retrieve
the flashlight. While "fiddling with the switch," he stepped
backward, thinking there was a ledge behind him. He fell
backwards about six feet, rolled off a ledge, and slid another
six feet head first on his back before coming to rest.
His helmet, caving clothes, knee pads, and forearm pads
protected most of his body from the sharp lava, but he

---------- Page 19 ----------
1999 Accident and Incident Reports
received lacerations on one forearm and one thigh. His injuries
were bandaged and later sutured. Fulks insisted on completing
a short re-mapping project and some scientific studies planned
for the trip, but the remainder of the trip was cancelled. During
the hike back to the car, his wrist began to swell painfully. X-
rays later showed a possible chip fracture.
William R. Halliday, Incident report, 17 February 1999.
Comments: Halliday reports that the primary cause of the
accident was "overconfidence," noting that, "initially, lack of
light was thought to have been a factor, but probably he would
have stepped backward regardless of the amount of light in the
alcove where his flashlight had rolled." Fulks was an
experienced caver and had been in the cave several times
before. His reasons for using a hand-held flashlight rather than
a helmet-mounted light are unknown.
Halliday also notes that the first aid kit carried by the
group was "mildly inadequate", lacking extra bandages and
sterile gauze pads. He also offers a warning regarding the
dangers of caving on sharp, jagged lava rock. There are
several incidents in this issue involving lacerations in lava
caves. Stout gloves and pads are advised.


********** 10 March
Ellisons Cave, Georgia
fatality, stranded on rope, hypothermia
Harold Allen (Hal) Bufford (28) entered the cave with two
companions, Chris Andrews (27) and Anthony Bates (25), on
Tuesday morning to descend Incredible Pit and explore
passages at the bottom. They entered the Stair Step Entrance
and descended an initial 80-foot pit and a second 83-foot pit
before reaching the lip of 440-foot deep Incredible Pit. There
was a sizeable stream flowing into the pit, forming a waterfall
for the entire length of the drop. A 1/2-inch rope, left by a
group the previous weekend, was already rigged in the pit.
The men rigged their own 7/16-inch rope next to it and
descended.
After exploring the passages below, they began their
ascent late Tuesday evening. Bates and Andrews climbed first
and made the ascent without incident. Bufford was the last to
climb, and began his ascent at about 11:30 p.m. Bufford
climbed about 150 feet up the rope and apparently
encountered some difficulty. His companions reported that he
began shouting for help at about 12:00 a.m. They could not
communicate with him because of the depth of the pit and the
noise of the waterfall. After losing contact with Bufford, Bates
and Andrews left the cave as quickly as possible and called
Walker County 911 at 2:30 a.m. GA DNR and Walker County
Cave Rescue were notified and dispatched to the cave.
Volunteer cave rescuers entered the cave and descended to
the top of Incredible Pit, arriving at about 9:00 a.m. They
called down to Bufford, but there was no response. Rescuers
rigged a hauling system with ropes and pulleys and hauled
Bufford to the top of the pit. There was no sign of life, and he
appeared to have been dead for many hours. His body was
placed in a stretcher and carried out of the cave, arriving on
the surface late Wednesday evening.
About 60 people from several government agencies and
volunteer rescue groups were involved in the operation. Of
those, 35 entered the cave and the rest provided command and
support functions on the surface.

3. Allen Padgett, Georgia Department of Natural Resources,
personal communication, 5 May 1999.
4. Diane Cousineau, Walker County Cave Rescue, personal
communication, undated.
Comments: Bufford was found on rope about 150 feet
above the floor of the 440-foot deep pit. From the arrangement
of his equipment, rescuers believe that he was attempting to
re-rig his equipment to switch from climbing to rappelling,
and became stranded on rope when he was unable to complete
the change-over procedure. He was found with one ascender
on each rope, with both under tension, and with his rappel rack
rigged on the 1/2-inch rope below his handled ascender. His
weight was on both ropes.
Rescuers believe that he was unable to transfer his weight
from the upper handled ascender to the rappel rack to
complete the change-over from climb to rappel, eventually lost
consciousness from hypothermia and exhaustion, and died
hanging in his harness. Cause of death was later determined to
be hypothermia plus positional asphyxia. This situation is
known as harness-induced pathology, sometimes referred to as
"harness-hang syndrome" or "suspension trauma."
Bufford and his companions rigged their own rope next to
another rope that was already hanging in the pit. Two ropes
rigged close together in a deep pit will often become tangled.
Bates and Andrews reported that they did not have any
problems due to tangling, but the ropes were found to be
entwined when Bufford's body was recovered. Whether this
occurred before or after his death is unknown.
Bufford was climbing the 1/2-inch rope using Petzl
ascenders designed for use with ropes up to 7/16-inch in
diameter. These ascenders do not run as smoothly on larger
diameter ropes, and this may also have been a factor.
Whatever the reason, he apparently decided to change over to
rappel and go back to the bottom. The ability to quickly and
efficiently change from climb to rappel or rappel to climb
while on rope is a basic and essential skill for vertical caving.
Cavers should be able to perform either maneuver in less than
five minutes. With practice, it can be done in less than one
minute. Hanging in a cold waterfall in the dark, your skill with
the procedure and familiarity with your equipment could save
your life.
Bufford also was not wearing adequate clothing for the
cave conditions. The pit has a stream pouring down it year-
round. At this time of the year it was near its peak, with a
large volume of 35-degree water pouring right down the rope
for the entire length. Most cavers would wear a full wetsuit or
a PVC or nylon caving jumpsuit over layered polypropylene
long-underwear. Bufford was dressed in a plastic rain suit over
denim overalls, a cotton thermal undershirt, and a cotton work
shirt. Cotton clothing is dangerous for wet caving because it
absorbs and holds water against the skin, increasing the risk
and effects of hypothermia. Plastic rain suits are not rugged
enough for the cave environment.
Bufford's clothing made him more susceptible to
hypothermia, and greatly limited the amount of time that he

---------- Page 20 ----------
1999 Accident and Incident Reports
could hang in the water to arrange his equipment. A wetsuit
would have substantially improved his chances of survival.
Wearing cotton, survival time in cold water is usually
measured in minutes.
This is the first death in Ellisons Cave, and the first caving
fatality in Georgia since 1967, when three men were killed in
Howards Waterfall Cave (Dade Co.) by fumes from a gasoline
explosion caused by a leaking underground storage tank.


********** 6 April
Hermit Cave, Oklahoma
fatality, stuck, inadequate equipment, bad air
Robert Canady (21) and two companions spent the night of
5 April camped in Hermits Cave. On the following morning,
one of the men had to leave to go to work, but Canady wanted
to do some more exploring. He decided to push a small side
passage. About 150 feet down the passage he became wedged
at a constriction and was unable to free himself. His arms were
pinned at his sides and he was face down above a mud floor.
His companion was not able to help, and eventually left the
cave to call for assistance. When rescuers reached Canady, he
had expired, apparently from suffocation.
1. David Carroll, Incident report, 9 April 1999.
2. Michael Smith and Omer Gillham, "Man trapped inside
cave found dead, 'Tulsa World, 7 April 1999.
Comments: Carroll reports that it was Canady's first
caving trip. He was dressed in jeans and a T-shirt and had one
flashlight, no backup lights, and no helmet. Carroll also notes
that the cave is known to have bad air and is subject to
frequent flooding. Rescuers encountered difficulty breathing
during the recovery operation, and a ventilation system was
used to blow warmed air into the cave. It was thought that
Canady became unable to hold himself out of the mud, losing
consciousness due to some combination of exhaustion and low
oxygen in the crawl.


********** 16 April
Pettijohns Cave, Georgia
stranded, inadequate equipment
On Friday night three individuals entered Pettijohns Cave
at about 11:00 p.m. By 12:30 a.m. they were about 1,000 feet
from the entrance when the last of their light sources failed.
They had no backup lights. They spent a cold night and most
of the next day sitting in the dark.
The following afternoon, the wife of one of the missing
men came looking for them and encountered other cavers,
who were there for a cave clean-up project, at the parking
area. The cavers called 911 to report the lost party and get
some help from the cave rescue team, and then made a quick
search of the entrance area and main passage of the cave.
More cavers and rescuers arrived, and a thorough search of the
cave was planned.
Before the full-scale search could begin, a group of college
students who had gone into the cave earlier in the day made
their way into a passage near the place where the lost party
was stranded. Hearing cries for help, they located the stranded
group, loaned them some warm clothes, and escorted them out
of the cave.
Allen Padgett, Incident report, 19 April 1999.
Comments: Flashlight caving: how many of us started
caving the same way? Properly equipped cavers carry at least
three sources of light per caver, not per group. At least this
group let someone know where they were going.


********** 21 April
New River Cave, Virginia
lost, stranded
A group of cavers from Concord College was exploring
the cave and decide to split into two groups. One caver, David
Arrington, became separated from the groups. Each group
thought he was with the other, and no one realized he was
missing until the two groups were reunited outside the cave.
Arrington had last been seen at about 10:30 p.m.
The Concord group re-entered the cave and spent about
two hours searching for Arrington, then exited and called in
other cavers to expand the search. Groups began entering the
cave at about 2:00 a.m. and spent the night searching.
Arrington was finally located at about 6:00 a.m. downstream
from the China Room. He was able to exit under his own

unspecified cave near Smyrna, Tennessee
caver fall
Timothy Newby (13) and friends were playing in the
entrance of a small cave near his home when Newby slipped
and fell about eight feet while climbing out of the narrow
moss-covered entrance slot. He suffered a broken arm and a
concussion.
One of Newby's companions climbed down the slot and
stayed with him while others went to call for help. EMS and
rescue personnel responded, packaging Newby in a litter and
hauling him up the drop. The narrow entrance hampered
rescue efforts. Newby was taken to a hospital where he was
later reported to be in fair condition.

********** 15 May
Alleghany Blowhole, Virginia
caver fall
Chris Alderson (52) and three other cavers were surveying
in virgin passage when they came to an 8-foot climb-down
over a boulder to a breakdown pile below. Two of the cavers
descended, but as Alderson climbed down over the boulder, it
broke loose. Alderson fell, along with the boulder and other
smaller rocks. She landed on the breakdown slope and slid
another six to eight feet as rocks fell around her. A broken
piece of the boulder landed on her forearm, causing a small
laceration.
Alderson's arm was bandaged using the group's first aid
kit, and she was able to continue the survey trip. On the way
out of the cave she experienced some pain in her left side,
which was later attributed to a separated rib. She exited with
minor assistance.
Chris Alderson, Incident report, 11 September 2000.
Comments: Alderson notes that virgin cave is often
unstable. Even though two other cavers had descended the
climb without incident, the rocks gave way unexpectedly.
Cavers must be alert for loose or unstable rock in caves, but
should be especially SO when they are in new cave or
infrequently traveled passage.


********** 21 May
Sinking Cove Cave, Tennessee
lost, stranded
Chuck Constable, Patrick Savage, and Anthony Stanaland
entered the Boulder Entrance at about 3:00 p.m. planning to
make the popular vertical through-trip. The route descends
several drops, followed by a squeeze into a low-airspace
crawlway that connects to a large stream passage 1,000 feet
upstream from the spring entrance. Constable was familiar
with the route, but it was the first time through for Savage and
Stanaland.
The trip went without incident until the trio reached the
squeeze into the water crawl. Constable had warned the others
about the tight spot, but was confident that they would both fit
through. Stanaland (the larger of the two) started into the
squeeze, then backed out and announced that he could not fit.
He decided to go back out the upper entrance, and Savage
decided to go with him. They had their climbing systems and
felt confident that they could find their way back, SO they told
Constable to go on out the bottom. They split up at about 5:00
p.m., and Constable exited shortly after and returned to the
group campsite near the spring.
When Savage and Stanaland had not arrived at the camp
by 10:00 p.m., Constable and Martha Hendrix decided to don
their caving gear and go looking for them. They entered the
Boulder Entrance at about 11:30 p.m. and soon found the
missing cavers. They had lost the route in the middle portion
of the cave, and decided to wait for their friends to come get
them. They had food and emergency blankets, but were out of
water. Hendrix and Constable led the way out, and all exited
without further difficulty.
Martha Hendrix, Incident report, 16 June 1999.
Comments: Hendrix suggests that it was probably not a
good idea for the group to split up, since Savage and
Stanaland did not know the cave. When following a guide
through unfamiliar cave it is important to take your time and
learn the route. Fortunately, the men were well prepared and
no harm was done. Hendrix also notes that the tight spot had
been significantly enlarged a few years earlier as a result of a
similar incident.


********** 29 May
Crumbly Cave, Tennessee
caver fall
Andy Porter was exploring Crumbly Cave, where he found
a small hole opening into a 10-foot climb-down. He squeezed
through the hole head-first and started to turn around SO he
could descend. As he did so, one of his footholds broke loose,
causing him to fall head-first down the pit. His head struck the
wall as he fell, and he tumbled, landing upright at the bottom.
Porter was stunned by the fall, and bleeding from a cut on
his ear. A companion helped him out of the cave, and another
applied first aid and accompanied him to a hospital emergency
room, where he received seven stitches to close the 1-inch
laceration in his ear. He had also received a mild concussion,
and suffered headaches for several days after the fall.
Andy Porter, Incident report, 1 June 1999.
Comments: Porter notes that his UIAA-approved helmet
saved him from a much more serious head injury. A quality
helmet is a wise investment in your caving future.


********** 30 May
Cueva Los Angeles, Puerto Rico
drowning, flood entrapment
Francis Reyes (34) was working as one of several guides
leading a group of clients on a commercial caving trip in
Cueva Los Angeles when the group encountered rapidly rising
water in the stream passage. One of the clients, Elba Vasquez
Gonzales, was unable to reach higher ground in time and
became caught in the flood pulse. Reyes went to her aid and
rescued her, but was swept away by the strong current and
drowned. The other guides led the group to a dry upper
passage and waited overnight for the flood to subside.
Rescuers were able to reach the 17 trapped cavers the next
day and help them exit the cave. Vasquez Gonzales had
suffered a head injury when she was thrown against rocks by

King Blair Cave, Indiana
stranded, inadequate equipment, inexperience
Bill (25), Sarah (20), Josh (18), and Siradan (17) entered
the King Blair entrance at about 11:00 a.m. on Saturday.
When they did not return home that night, Sarah and Josh's
parents called authorities and reported them missing in the
cave. The cave rescue team was summoned to the site at 6:00
a.m. Sunday morning. Search groups were sent into the King
Blair and Triple-J entrances. At about 9:45 a.m., the King
Blair search group located the stranded cavers.
The group had become lost, and eventually stranded when
their primary lights failed. Two were dressed in jeans and T-
shirts, and two were wearing cotton sweatshirts. All were cold.
Only two of them had helmets and helmet-mounted lights.
Rescuers gave them food and water, and then escorted them
out of the cave.
Jim Johnson, Incident report, Jim's Cave Rescue Page,
php.indiana.edu/~jkjohnso/cr1999.html.
Comments: Johnson observes that the group was
"underexperienced for a cave of this complexity" as well as
"underdressed and underequipped." He notes that they did tell
their parents where they were going and when they expected
to be out.


********** 12 June
The Kids Cave, Alabama
rockfall, rig point collapsed
A group of cavers entered The Kids Cave, descending the
41-foot entrance pit and additional pits of 90, 150, 30, and 40
feet to reach the bottom of the cave. On the way out, Ray
Craig (29) was the first to climb the 90-foot pit. When he
reached a point about 15 feet below the top, part of the anchor
failed, dropping Craig about six feet and sending a shower of
rocks down the pit.
The backup rig held the fall, and Craig was not injured. He
grabbed a fluted projection on the wall and re-belayed the rope
to it, then climbed cautiously up to the lip and over. The
primary rig point had been a 3-inch diameter, 7-inch tall
stalagmite on a flowstone shelf, backed up to a 2'x2'x7'
breakdown slab. Craig found that the entire flowstone shelf
had collapsed, breaking loose along hidden internal fractures
or cleavage. Most of the larger pieces from the collapse did
not fall into the pit. After Craig finished checking the rope and
anchor, the others ascended and the group exited without
further incident.
Andy Porter, Incident report, 15 June 1999.
Comments: The stalagmite was used to rebelay the rope to
get a better angle where the rope entered the pit. The resulting
deviation in the path of the rope from the breakdown slab
anchor to the pit lip allowed Craig to fall about six feet. Porter
calculated that the fall factor was about 0.2.
Static ropes are not designed to catch falls like this. They
can also be cut by a caver's ascenders or by a sharp lip under
this kind of dynamic loading. Anchor systems should be
carefully constructed to minimize, if not eliminate, dynamic
loading in the event of partial failure. Formations are suspect
anchors, due to their tendency to fracture and the fact that their
deposition process tends to hide weaknesses over time.

John Keogh, Rick Pingree, and Greg Racicot were
working on a dig in the entrance passage of Perseverance

Bears Plunge, Alaska
difficulty on rope
Bruce White and six other cavers rigged the 150-foot
entrance drop of Bears Plunge, placing the rope to one side to
avoid the large waterfall. White descended first, followed by
Dan, Connie, and Diane. Mike and Kris decided to stay on top,
and Dave descended last. As Dave went down the drop, the
rope slipped over to the waterfall side of the pit.
Communication from the bottom to the top was not possible
due to the water, SO they could not get the cavers topside to
reposition the rope.
White volunteered to climb out in the water. He made his
climb without incident and repositioned the rope for the
others. Diane and Connie climbed out without difficulty, and
the group waited as Dave began his ascent. Dan remained on
the bottom to be the last one up.
After about 30 minutes, White became concerned and
rigged a second rope SO that he could climb down to a ledge at
the lip and check on Dave. He found that Dave was climbing
slowly, but appeared to be OK. White went back to the surface
and waited another 20 minutes, then descended to check again.
Dave had made it about halfway up the pit, and appeared to be
struggling. White called down and asked Dave if he needed
help, to which Dave replied in the affirmative.
White went back to the surface and picked up some
additional equipment, including a pick-off strap, carabiners,
and some webbing, and rappelled down to Dave. He found
that Dave's chest harness and seat harness had both loosened
to the point where Dave was almost unable to climb. The seat

---------- Page 23 ----------
1999 Accident and Incident Reports
harness was down around his knees and the chest harness was
riding up around his neck.
White used the pick-off strap and webbing to rig a safety
sling around Dave, and then maneuvered the two onto a ledge
in an alcove away from the waterfall. After some struggling to
gain the ledge, they were able to adjust and reinforce Dave's
harnesses and make them secure. The two then swung back
out into the pit and resumed the climb to the surface.
Both were exhausted from the struggle and chilled from
exposure to the waterfall. They climbed slowly out, taking
frequent rests, and eventually made the surface. Dan then
climbed out without incident.
Bruce White, "June 1999, POW, Mission: Drop Bear's
Plunge, for the Glory, The Alaskan Caver, v20n4, August
2000, p. 3.
Comments: White notes that Dave was using new gear that
he was not familiar with, and had not done any rope work in
some time. His skills and ability level were not known to the
others on the trip. White observes that had they known, the
others might have cautioned him about going down in the wet
conditions. All agreed that Dave could have been seriously
injured or killed.
Cavers should understand their equipment, practice with it
outside the caves, keep it in good working order, and be able
to use it in adverse conditions. You can die stranded on rope in
a waterfall, as demonstrated in the Ellisons Cave incident
reported earlier in this issue. Cavers should also know their
companions and be aware of their skills, abilities, and
equipment. It is not impolite to inquire about these things-it
is just part of good team ethics. If you don't know, ask.


********** 4 July
Bowden Cave, West Virginia
caver fall, inadequate equipment, intoxication
Around 11:15 p.m. a group of eight individuals comprised
of three women and five men (ages ranging from 15 to 36)
entered the Bear Heaven Entrance to Bowden Cave. The
group had several flashlights, no helmets, and no safety
equipment. They were dressed in jeans, sweat shirts, and
tennis shoes, and had minimal caving experience.
As they made their way to a climb-down at a fissure just
inside the entrance, Mark Summerfield (19) was on a mud
slope above others in the group when he slipped and fell about
30 feet to the bottom of the passage. One of his companions
climbed down to him and found him unconscious, with a head
injury, broken ribs, and labored breathing.
Members of the party left the cave and called for help.
Rescuers responded and placed Summerfield in a litter and
carried him out of the cave. He was then taken to a hospital. It
was reported that he had a broken collarbone and broken ribs,
with possible internal organ damage.
Chuck Hempel, "Bowden Cave July 1999, West Virginia
Caver, v17n5, October 1999, p. 8.
Comments: Rescuers reported that members of the party
smelled of alcohol, SO intoxication may have been a factor.
The group also did not have proper caving equipment or safety
equipment. Lug-soled boots are much safer than tennis shoes
on mud slopes. A good helmet is essential for safe caving. A
belay or handline is worth considering when there is risk of a
30-foot fall.


********** 24 July
Knox Cave, New York
stuck, stranded
Eight cavers from the Nittany Grotto entered the cave at
about 2:15 p.m. After several hours touring the cave, the group
proceeded to the well-known Gun Barrel passage. Five of the
cavers went through, and three, including trip leader Rob
Martin (31) decided not to go through. After a while, two of
the waiting cavers became cold and decided to go outside. By
5:45 p.m., two of the cavers had come back through the Gun
Barrel and exited the cave, when another emerged and
reported that someone was stuck.
While making her way out of the Gun Barrel, Carrie
Shaffer (late 20's) got stuck about ten feet from the end of the
passage when her knee became wedged in the slot in the
bottom of the passage. First-time caver Rosario Gonzales
Martin (early 20's) was behind her in the passage and could
not get around.
Martin and the other cavers tried to help Shaffer, pulling
on her torso as Gonzales Martin tried from behind to free her
leg. They retrieved a digging bar from a nearby dig site and
tried to clear rocks and gravel from the slot, but could not free
Shaffer's knee. At 6:15 p.m. they sent a caver to the surface to
get help. While they waited, Gonzales Martin backed out of
the passage into a nearby room to keep warm. Hot packs were
passed to Shaffer to help prevent hypothermia. The group tried
various methods including applying soap to Shaffer's knee
and using a foot loop for her to push against, but still could not
free her.
After about 45 minutes, rescuers arrived. A very small
caver was able to squeeze past Shaffer in the passage and get
behind her. With rescuers digging and clearing material from
both sides, Shaffer's knee was freed from the slot at about
10:00 p.m. She had some bruises and abrasions, but no serious
injury. Shaffer and Gonzales Martin exited under their own
power.
Rob Martin, "Rescue in Knox Cave, Northeastern Caver,

Comments: Chuck Porter reports that on 11 January, 1970,
a 14-year-old boy got his knee wedged in the same place,
trapping 17 people behind him in the cave for several hours
until he could be freed.


********** 28 July
Nutty Putty Cave, Utah
stuck, stranded
Chris Hale (17) and Chris Marrow (17) were exploring
Nutty Putty Cave when they came to a small opening into a
crawlway. Marrow went in first, followed closely by Hale.
Marrow decided that the passage ended, but could not back
out because Hale was behind him. Hale tried to exit, but found
that he could not make it back through a constriction at the
beginning of the passage. He was confined to a small chamber

---------- Page 24 ----------
1999 Accident and Incident Reports
in the crawlway, with Marrow trapped behind him, head-down
in the sloping crawl. Authorities were called by other visitors
to the cave who encountered the trapped pair.
When they arrived at the cave, rescuers found that the
passage was SO tight that only one person could get close to
the stranded cavers. Rescuer Shay Lelegren spent six hours in
the cave trying various techniques to get Hale through the
constriction without success. When Lelegren became fatigued,
Kory Kowalis took over, attempting to widen the passage with
a rock hammer and providing encouragement to Hale to keep
trying. After about four hours, Hale was able to squeeze out of
the passage on his third try. Marrow had been lying head-
down for over 14 hours by this time, and was exhausted. With
Kowalis pulling him by one ankle, he was able to heave and
squirm his way up the slope and out of the crawl. The two
boys received only minor scrapes from their incident.
1. Associated Press, "Utah Deputies free teens from cave,"

2. Rodney E. Mulder, Incident report, 7 January 2000.
Comments: Mulder reports that the cave is a popular
destination, seeing more than 200 visitors each week. Most are
equipped only with flashlights, as were Hale and Marrow. The
cave has been the scene of numerous minor injuries, incidents,
and escapades. Rescuers have been called to the cave
repeatedly, but this was the first reported incident in which the
victims were unable to get themselves out.


********** 31 July
Bowden Cave, West Virginia
stranded, inadequate equipment
At about 3:00 p.m., Sharon Wright (27), a counselor at
nearby Valley Vista Christian Camp, entered the main
entrance leading a group of six kids (ages 10 to 19) from the
camp on a trip to the upper Bear Heaven Entrance. The cavers
were equipped with flashlights and hardhats, carried a
communal pack with food and water, and were dressed in
jeans and T-shirts.
In several hours of strenuous caving covering more than a
mile of cave passage, including hundreds of feet of wading
through the stream passage, the group reached the bottom of a
20-foot pit leading up to the Bear Heaven Entrance. Wright
had expected to find an old handline rigged there for them to
use in climbing the pit. Unfortunately, the rope had been
removed. The kids were wet and cold, and they did not have
enough batteries for their lights to allow them to retrace their
route back to the main entrance. They sat down to wait for
rescue.
When the group had not returned to the camp by 9:00 p.m.
the camp director drove to the cave and called for help after
finding their cars at the entrance. Rescuers responded and
organized a search of the cave. Parties were sent into each
entrance, and the stranded group was soon located. Rescuers
rigged a haul system and pulled them out of the cave by 6:30
a.m.
Chuck Hempel, "Bowden Cave July 1999, West Virginia
Caver, v17n5, October 1999, p. 9.
Comments: Hempel notes that the group had been in the
cave earlier in the week on a shorter trip. They had a map of
the cave and some information about the route, but were not
properly dressed or equipped for the trip. Several of the
younger kids were very cold by the time they were rescued.
Wright did not check for the presence of the handline at the
exit before starting the trip, and did not bring enough batteries
for the lights.
Hempel also notes that the camp had used cavers for help
leading such trips the previous summer, and that Wright had
been rescued from the maze section of the cave some years
earlier after getting lost.


********** 14 August
B&G Sinkhole, Utah
stranded on rope
Rodney Mulder, Doug Zeddis, Wesley Gurney, and Brent
Hobbs were visiting the cave to evaluate it for possible future
rescue operations. They rigged the pit and Zeddis descended.
When he reached the end of the rope, he found that it was still
about 40 feet above the floor. He switched to his ascenders to
climb back up and get another rope, but soon ran into
difficulty when his ascenders became clogged with mud and
would not grip the rope. After struggling to clean and use the
ascenders, he gave up and called up to the others for
assistance. The others rigged a haul system and pulled him
back up. Zeddis was covered in cold mud and was very
chilled, but was otherwise unharmed.

********** 22 August
Sotano del Aire, Mexico
fatality, stranded, rockfall
Christy Quintana (26), Miguel Angel Blanco Rocio
Medina, Cuauhtemoc Sanchez, Sergio Sanchez-Armass, and
Alfredo Silva arrived at Sotano del Aire in the mid-afternoon
after a two-hour hike. They cleared rocks around the lip and
rigged a rope in the 764-foot entrance drop. Blanco, Quintana,
Medina, and Sanchez descended, while Silva and Sanchez-
Armass remained on the surface.
At about 10:30 p.m., Quintana and Blanco were climbing
out when a large portion of the left side of the lip area of the
entrance collapsed into the pit. Quintana was about 130 feet
below the lip, with Blanco a short distance below her on the
same rope just above a constriction in the pit at -180 feet.
Quintana was struck on the head, shoulders, and back by
several large rocks. Blanco was on a flowstone ramp that
placed him off to one side of the pit, and was not hit. Several
of the rocks came to rest on the flowstone slope just below
him in an unstable position. He climbed up to Quintana and
found that she had been severely injured. She had been hit in
the neck and lower back, and her legs were paralyzed.
After doing his best to stabilize and comfort her, Blanco
decided that the best course of action was to climb out, rig a
haul system, and pull her up. He passed her on rope and
climbed to the top, reaching the surface at about 11:30 p.m.
The cavers then rigged a haul system using the caving
equipment that they had available. They had no pulleys or

---------- Page 25 ----------
1999 Accident and Incident Reports
rescue equipment, and had to make do with a straight haul
with no mechanical advantage. Three large rocks at the lip
were in an unstable position after the collapse, and had to be
secured before they could begin.
By about 2:30 a.m. Quintana was about 12 feet below the
lip. Blanco rappelled down to help get her over the lip and
found that she had died. They tried to pull her the rest of the
way to the surface, but were unable to get her body over the
lip. Sanchez-Armass then made the two-hour hike back to the
vehicle and went for help. Medina and Sanchez remained
stranded at the bottom of the entrance pit.
By 11:00 a.m. a rescue team had arrived at the cave. They
first removed the loose rocks at the lip, and then continued
with the recovery. At about 2:00 p.m. rescuers were finally
able to descend to the constriction 180 feet down and clear the
loose rocks that had come to rest on the flowstone slope at the
constriction. A rescuer descended to take food and water to
Medina and Sanchez, who had been waiting for over 16 hours,
and tell them it was now safe to climb. They reached the
surface at about 5:00 p.m.

September/October 1999, p. 80.
2. Claire Osborn, "Georgetown spelunker killed at Mexico
cave,' Austin American Statesman, 26 August 1999.
Comments: Quintana was struck on the head and lower
back by several large rocks which fell more than 100 feet,
resulting in fractures of her cervical and lumbar vertebrae,
paralysis in her legs, and probably internal injuries as well.
Her position on rope and in a remote backcountry location
meant that hours would pass before she could receive
necessary medical treatment. In his report on the incident, Ivy
states that her fellow cavers did everything they could do, but
were faced with an impossible situation.
Ivy also observes that Quintana's immobility while on
rope made her susceptible to harness-induced pathology,
known to cavers and climbers as harness-hang syndrome and
also known as compression avascularization/re-perfusion
syndrome, When a caver is hanging immobile in a harness on
rope due to some condition such as exhaustion,
unconsciousness, or paralysis, a serious medical condition
arises. The mechanics of the syndrome are not fully
understood, but it is thought to be related to impairment of
circulation, resulting in shock and leading to unconsciousness
in 15 to 30 minutes, followed soon after by death. As Ivy
observes, Quintana needed to be off rope, lying down, and
treated for shock within 10-15 minutes after her injury.
It is not known whether Quintana succumbed to internal
injuries or to harness-induced pathology, perhaps after losing
consciousness due to those injuries. It is worth noting,
however, that it is vitally important to get an injured or
unconscious caver off rope as quickly as possible, preferably
within 15 minutes. Lowering the caver to the bottom of the pit,
or performing a pick-off and rappelling with her to the bottom
might be possible when circumstances permit.
Cavers should develop and practice these skills in order to
have another tool and another option in such a situation.
Sometimes it might be better to get the patient back down to
the bottom, keep her warm and stable, and wait for help. In
this case, given Quintana's spinal and internal injuries and the
broken and constricted nature of the drop, descending the pit
might also have been fatal. Further, there is no guarantee that
she would not have expired due to internal bleeding, spinal
trauma, or other causes once off rope. It seems likely, as Ivy
asserts, that her injuries were simply not survivable, regardless
of the course of action chosen.


********** 28 August
Scott Hollow Cave, West Virginia
caver fall
Philip Henry (37), Kim Hedges, Kenny Hedges, and Clay
Whittaker had spent several hours touring Scott Hollow Cave
and were on their way out when they lost the route, climbing
up rather than down at a junction. They soon realized their
mistake, and determined that they needed to get down to the
stream level below.
Kenny Hedges climbed down and encountered other
cavers, who confirmed that the stream route was the correct
one. Some of the others did not like the looks of the climb-
down, and searched for another way down. Henry was about
30 feet above the stream near the ceiling of the passage when
he spotted an opening in the breakdown that he thought might
provide a way on. He climbed through the opening to get a
better look, but as he popped through and tried to sit down, he
began to slide uncontrollably in slick mud. He fell about ten
feet down the canyon, striking a ledge during his fall, before
he was able to stop himself by spreading his arms and legs
against the walls.
He came to rest about 20 feet above the stream, wedged in
a chimneying position. The others heard his fall, and started to
come to his aid. In the process, a large rock was dislodged and
fell down to the stream, narrowly missing Kenny Hedges.
Hedges was able to climb up to Henry and help him to get into
a stable position sitting on a small ledge.
Henry had fractured four of his ribs in the fall, and was in
a lot of pain. After some rest and evaluation, Hedges was able
to help Henry make his way down to the stream. There they
met another group which happened to include Daryl Trusty, a
paramedic. Trusty examined Henry, and they discussed
whether to send for help or try to self-rescue. Henry felt that
he could make it out, and that he would rather start moving
toward the entrance than sit and wait several hours for help to
arrive. They headed out, and Henry was able to make it out of
the cave with minimal assistance. Trusty accompanied him to
the hospital, where he was treated and released.

cave in the company of two other cavers. Milhollin and
Cunningham were comfortable and decided to continue.
Much of the passage was in neck-deep water, and in some
areas the cavers had to maneuver along channels in the low
ceiling between formations and solution features, with
occasional low-airspace sections and duck-unders. As
Milhollin was leading through one of the low sections, he
heard some unusual sounds behind him. When he turned and
looked back, he saw that Cunningham was underwater,
struggling to find a spot with enough airspace to breathe. He
was caught under some remnant ceiling projections in a space
too small to surface, and was thrashing in the water but not
making any progress.
Milhollin took a deep breath and swam back into the low
area to help. He was wearing a swim mask, and was able to
see Cunningham and grab his arm. He swam back toward
larger passage, pulling Cunningham with him, until they could
both surface. Cunningham had been underwater for some
time, and was in distress. Milhollin was also shaken by the
close call.
After several minutes, the cavers regained their
composure, and Cunningham decided he would like to
continue. They soon reached the end of the passage, and then
carefully made their way back through the low areas and
exited the cave.
R. D. Milhollin, Incident report, 30 July 2000.
Comments: Milhollin reports that the incident occurred
when Cunningham's helmet-mounted light snagged on the
ceiling, tipping his head back and forcing him underwater as
he moved through the low-airspace. He observes that tipping
the head to one side can help prevent this from happening.


********** 11 September
Ellisons Cave, Georgia
stranded in pit
Bill Baus, Steve Collins, and five other cavers descended
586-foot Fantastic Pit, went through the Glub-Glub Crawls,
descended 34-foot Mark's Pit, and made their way to the
bottom of the cave. On the way out, they split into two groups
of three. Baus and two others remained behind for some
photography while Collins and the rest went on to climb the
big pit.
After finishing their photography, Baus and the second
group reached the bottom of Fantastic Pit just as the last
climber in the first group was reaching the top. As Baus and
his two companions were changing out of their wetsuits and
preparing for the climb, they heard a whooshing sound and a
loud "whack!" Their changing area was in a dry alcove well
away from the main shaft, SO they could not see what had
fallen. They called to the top to ask what had happened. The
reply that came back was, "Off rope!" "What fell?" they
asked. "Rope," was the response. Voice communication is
somewhat difficult in the 600-foot shaft.
None of them had shoes on at the time, and it was several
minutes before anyone was able to go check on the rope.
When they did, they were chagrined to find that the rope was
not on bottom. They could hear the cavers above departing,
and yelled for help, but were not heard. Since they were
expected to need several hours to climb the pit, de-rig, exit the
cave, and hike to camp, they knew they would not be missed
for quite some time. Stranded, they bundled up with dry
clothing and settled down to wait. It was 1:00 a.m.
At 8:40 a.m., they heard Steve Collins arrive at the top of
the pit as he returned to check on them. They explained their
problem, and Collins pulled the rope up, untangled it, and
lowered it back down. The three cavers climbed out, and the
group exited the cave at 12:30 p.m.
William Baus, Incident report, 15 September 2000.
Comments: The rope had become snagged on the pack of
the last climber in the first group. When he reached the lip, it
was dislodged and fell back into the pit. Unfortunately, it
snarled during the fall, and the end was left hanging more than
200 feet above the bottom.
Baus offers several observations on the situation. First,
since they knew there had been a problem with the rope, the
first group should not have left the top of the pit until they had
confirmation from the group on the bottom that everything
was OK. Second, one of the cavers on the bottom should have
pulled on shoes and gone to check on the rope sooner, instead
of taking their time to finish gearing up.
Baus also notes that another group had been in the cave
earlier in the day and used the same rope. If the same thing
had happened to the last climber of that unrelated group, the
results could have been serious, since the six cavers would
have been stranded for several days before being missed.
In general, cavers should make it their practice to check on
and resolve any problems in rigging that occur before leaving
whenever there are others below them who will be depending
on that rigging. This may require that someone re-descend to
make sure the rope reaches bottom. It is our responsibility to
leave a safe rig for those who follow us.


********** 19 September
Knox Cave, New York
stuck
Nigel Dyson-Hudson was moving through the Gun Barrel
on his way into the cave when his knee became stuck in the
slot in the bottom of the passage. He was moving through the
passage with his right side down, pushing with his right foot.
After about ten feet, he stopped to rest, pushed his pack ahead,
and then had to lean forward to pull it back when it slipped
down into the slot. When he started to move forward, he
realized that he was stuck. His two companions had gone
ahead of him, and he was now blocking the passage, SO no one
could go for help, and no one was likely to come looking until
someone noticed their cars in the parking area.
He told his fellow cavers what had happened, and set to
work to try to free his leg. After about 15 minutes, he had
worked himself into a stooping position but had not made
much progress. Suddenly, as he rolled to the left his knee
came free. He shouted to let the others know, and backed out
of the passage.
Nigel Dyson-Hudson, Letter to the Editor, Northeastern Caver,
March 2000.

---------- Page 27 ----------
1999 Accident and Incident Reports
Comments: Dyson-Hudson got stuck in the same place
where Carrie Shaffer got stuck on 24 July. The Gun Barrel is a
keyhole-shaped passage, and it is easy for any caver to get a
knee or leg jammed in the slot. Cavers had filled the slot with
mud from a nearby dig after the previous incident, but recent
rains had apparently washed it out and re-set the trap. One of
the other cavers had gone through on her back to avoid the
slot.


********** 19 September
unnamed pit, Lawrence County, Indiana
"caver" fall, intoxication
Paul (48) was drinking with friends and decided to explore
a cave entrance near his home. The entrance was a 30-foot pit,
and Paul had no rope or vertical gear. Nevertheless, he took a
flashlight and attempted to descend the pit. He fell about 20
feet, bounced on the dirt slope at the bottom, and fell another
ten feet. He was not wearing a helmet. His flashlight was
destroyed on impact.
Paul's friends called for help, and EMS and cave rescuers
soon responded. Rescuers descended and found Paul
unharmed, except for minor bruises and abrasions. He was
fitted with a seat harness and hauled out of the pit. Once on
the surface, he refused medical treatment.

Tongue River Cave, Wyoming
caver fall
Rescuers spent about eight hours retrieving a man from
Tongue River Cave after he was injured in a fall. He was
reported to have fallen about 50 feet while climbing near a
waterfall in the back of the cave. Rescuers were aided by
members of the Tongue River High School football team, who
carried in supplies and helped haul the litter.

Similar incidents occurred there in October 1998, November
1999, and March and April 2000.


********** 25 October
unspecified cave near Eagle Rock, Missouri
caver fall, climbing hand-over-hand
Dale Jetton (35) and his nephew Mark Scallorn (16) used a
thin nylon rope to descend hand-over-hand to the bottom of
the 25-foot entrance pit and went exploring. When they tried
to leave, Jetton, who is diabetic and had recently had gall
bladder surgery, was unable to grip the rope and climb out. He
reportedly fell four times while trying, suffering various
injuries to his head and back. Scallorn tried to get Jetton to
give him the keys to his truck SO he could go for help, but
Jetton refused. Scallorn later told reporters, "My uncle don't
loan his truck to anyone, SO I just ran."
When rescuers arrived, they placed Jetton in a litter and
pulled him up the drop and out of the cave. The extraction
took several hours due to the tight entrance. Jetton was semi-
conscious by the time he was out. He was taken to a hospital
where he was treated for hypothermia, shock, head lacerations,
and a broken vertebra.
Michelle Bradford, "Spelunker waits hours for rescue,"

Comments: The hand-over-hand vertical technique claims
another victim. Apparently, he was not wearing a helmet
either. We offer no comment regarding the truck situation.


********** 30 October
Guffey Cave, Alabama
rockfall, broken legs
A caver named Art was injured about 1,000 feet into the
cave when a rock broke loose and rolled across his lower legs,
causing a compound fracture of the tibia and fibula of one leg
and a possible fracture of the other leg. Some of his fellow
cavers exited and called for help. Rescuers responded, placing
him in a litter and carrying him to the base of the 25-foot
climb in the entrance room. There he was hauled up the climb
and out of the cave, reaching the surface about four hours after
the accident

********** 31 October
Devils Pocket Cave, Alabama
rockfall, anchor failure, caver fall
Doug Strait, Paul Aughey, Joe Corrado, and Andy Porter
entered the cave and descended a 71-foot pit. A crawl led to
the top of another pit, an offset 37-foot drop broken by a ledge
12 feet down. They rigged their rope to a group of fluted
projections on the side of a house-sized piece of breakdown.
Strait descended first, climbing down the first 12 feet to the
ledge and then rappelling 25 feet to the floor.
Porter rigged in and rappelled to the ledge and had just
started down the remaining 25-foot drop when a large section
of the boulder they had rigged to broke free and fell towards
the drop. Aughey had just started to climb down to the ledge,
and was able to jump out of the way as the slab broke into
pieces and tumbled into the pit. As the rig point collapsed,
Porter was dropped about 15 feet to the floor of the pit.
Hearing the sound of massive rockfall above, Porter dove
into a crack in the wall as chunks of the slab rained down.
Fortunately, the largest piece of the slab, a chunk about four
feet long, three feet wide, and 18 inches thick, landed on the
ledge and stayed there. Porter was unharmed, and Aughey re-
rigged the drop SO that he and Strait could climb out.
Andy Porter, Incident report, 1 November 1999.
Comments: The cavers examined the place where the slab
had broken off from the boulder and found that it had
separated along a concealed mud-filled fracture. There was no

---------- Page 28 ----------
1999 Accident and Incident Reports
evidence of the fracture on the surface of the slab prior to the
incident.
Porter notes that this was the third time he has had rigging
fail while on rope, and that he has witnessed three other
rigging failures involving other people. Cavers are advised to
always inspect rigging and anchors very closely and with a
suspicious eye. Whenever possible, use a back-up anchor "just
in case." Even "house-sized boulders" must be carefully
inspected. In this case, ironically, Porter was able to avoid
being hit by rockfall only because there was no backup anchor
to keep him suspended in the pit.


********** 6 November
Tongue River Cave, Wyoming
caver fall
Robin Paulekas (18) was on a high-school field trip when
she fell about ten feet onto boulders in the cave. The fall
occurred at about 1:30 p.m. She received a deep laceration on
her head, as well as possible back injuries. The authorities
were notified, and she was retrieved from the cave by rescuers
from the Sheridan Fire and Emergency service, the Dayton
Volunteer Fire Department, and Sheridan Area Search and
Rescue. She was taken to a hospital, where she was later
reported to be in intensive care.

********** 7 November
unspecified Monroe County cave, Illinois
caver fall
Philip Moss was sketching as he and three companions
surveyed in virgin passage in a secret project cave. Moss
walked over to look at a small waterfall that was coming out
of an undercut in the passage. He was straddling the passage
with his feet on two different ledges when the ledge under his
left foot broke. He braced himself with his arms and his right
leg to keep from falling, When he did so, his right knee was
bent unnaturally. He avoided the fall, but suffered a strain
injury to his knee.
It was very painful at first, but the pain diminished and he
felt he could continue the survey. He soon found that crawling
was very painful, SO they decided to leave the cave. He made
it out without assistance. When he removed his wetsuit, he
realized that the neoprene had been providing a lot of support
for his knee, and that he had suffered a serious injury. He went
to a doctor, and was given an immobilizing brace to wear for a
month. His knee ligaments had been strained, but not torn.
Philip Moss, Incident report, 15 December 1999.


********** 11 November
J-4 Cave, Pennsylvania
caver fall
A group of students from a college class was exploring in
J-4 cave when one caver fell at the Step Across. He reportedly
tried to keep both feet on a small sloping ledge rather than
leaning out to the opposite wall for support. He lost his
balance and fell to one side, landing about 12 feet below. He
suffered compression fractures of his lower vertebrae in the
impact.
The injured caver was able to crawl a short distance, but
could not make his way out of the cave. His companions sent
for help, and rescuers from the fire department and the cave
rescue team soon arrived. The injured man was placed in a
litter and carried out of the cave. The extrication took about
four and a half hours.

Clarksville Cave, New York
stuck, inexperience
Members of the Syracuse University Outing Club were
leading a trip in Clarksville Cave for a Boy Scout troop. At
about 3:00 p.m., a 13-year-old, 140-pound scout named Matt
became stuck in the lower slot of a passage called The Snake.
He was wedged in an upright position with his chest and
stomach compressed. When his companions were unable to
free him, help was summoned.
Rescuers received the call at about 5:15 p.m. and reached
the trapped scout at about 6:30 p.m. They placed slings under
his feet and raised him up, then piled rocks under his feet for
him to push against. Eventually he was able to squeeze up into
the larger tube at the top of the passage and crawl out. He
made his way out of the cave on his own, exiting at about 9:30
p.m.

********** 20 November
Cave Mountain Cave, West Virginia
caver fall
Ken Tayman (51) and seven other cavers from the Franklin
County Grotto were about 15 minutes into the cave when they
came to a climb-down to a lower level. As he started to
descend, Tayman leaned over to put his hand on the rock
where his foot was resting. His foot slipped, and his hand
missed the rock and he fell several feet, striking the wall with
his left knee and then his face. When he tried to stand, his left
leg would not support him.
With some assistance, Tayman was able to climb back up
into the room above, where his injuries were examined. He
had suffered lacerations to his lower lip and forehead, and an
apparent fracture of his left leg just below the knee. He was

---------- Page 29 ----------
1999 Accident and Incident Reports
unable to walk, but once his knee was immobilized he felt he
might be able to crawl to the entrance with some help.
The cavers started out, and some members of the group
were dispatched to retrieve a stretcher and get help. As they
made their way out, they met another group coming in which
happened to include two EMT's. They checked Tayman's
condition and directed the construction of a rope litter, which
was then used to carry Tayman the rest of the way to the
entrance.
On the surface, they once again checked Tayman's
condition while waiting for the stretcher to be carried up the
hill. Once it arrived, Tayman was strapped in and carried
down the steep trail to the parking area and then driven to a
hospital for treatment.

lacerations on his face and an immobilizing brace for his leg.


********** 4 December
Luminary Pit, Tennessee
stranded in pit
Paul Putman (mid 30's) became stranded at the bottom of
the 150-foot entrance drop when his rope was damaged by a
sharp edge at the lip of the pit. A friend on the surface went
for help, and the cave rescue team was called to the scene.
They padded the sharp edge, rigged a new rope, and lowered it
into the pit. Putman was then able to climb out on his own.
Earl Pelfrey Jr., Incident report, 7 December 1999.
Comments: Pelfrey notes that the incident could have been
avoided if Putman had used a rope pad. It is not clear why the
friend was unable to pull up the rope, tie a loop to isolate the
damaged spot, pad the lip with some clothing or a pack, and
enable Putman to climb out.


********** 11 December
Fern Cave, Alabama
caver fall
Chris Hudson and three other cavers entered the Johnson
Entrance at about 11:00 a.m. and proceeded down the West
Passage, a canyon passage with multiple levels that requires
chimneying and traversing along a series of ledges. About
1,000 feet down the passage, they came to a place where the
floor dropped away to a ledge about four feet below, followed
by another four-foot drop to a lower level. As Hudson crossed
over the gap, he lost his balance and fell, striking the ledge
and falling to the lower level. When he hit the ledge, he broke
his arm.
The others quickly climbed down to help. Hudson had
sustained a closed fracture of the radius and a displaced ulna.
They splinted his arm using a rappel rack and some accessory
cord and fashioned a sling out of a spare polypro shirt. Once
that was arranged, Hudson was able to exit under his own
power. He was then driven to a hospital for treatment of the
injury.

splint and sling for Hudson's arm.


********** 12 December
Marshall Cave, Virginia
caver fall
A 25-year old man was injured in the back of the cave,
requiring an extensive rescue operation. He was reported to
have back, hip, and leg injuries. Rescuers worked through the
evening to haul him up three short drops and carry him out of
the cave. No other details on the nature of the accident and the
man's injuries were available.

********** 23 December
Sistema Tepepa, Mexico
caver fall, flood entrapment
Two teams from the Société Québécoise de Speleologie
(SQS) entered the TP4-13 entrance on 23 December to
continue the exploration and survey of an area about one
kilometer from the entrance. One team set off to explore a
gallery at -350 meters, while the other team, comprised of
Alain Goupil (32) and fellow team members Bastien Michau
(25) and Eric Hamel (21), set about exploring passages at the -
300 meter level. They planned to rendezvous at 8:00 p.m. and
exit the cave.
At about 4:30 p.m., Goupil was moving sideways along a
high canyon using small ledges and projections when a
stalagmite that he was using as a handhold broke off the wall,
sending him falling to the floor about six meters below. He
landed on his right side and suffered injuries to his hip, side,
and lower back.
Hamel witnessed the fall and rushed to Goupil's aid,
calling for Michau. Michau heard the call for help and ran
toward the scene of the accident. In his haste, he tripped and
injured his right ankle. When they regained their composure,
the cavers assessed Goupil's injuries. He had pain in his right
shoulder, right elbow, left heel, and right leg, had a sprained
left thumb, had significant pain on the right side of his lower
back in the L5 region, had pain in his right hip, and could not
lift his right leg.
Michau was dispatched to try to locate the other team, but
returned unsuccessful after an hour and a half. He then left for
the surface, marking the route as he went. Hamel remained
with Goupil, and did what he could to make him comfortable.
Michau exited the cave in a little over three hours and
reached base camp at 9:45 p.m. in pouring rain. He informed
the other two expedition members of the accident, and the
group began assembling supplies and making plans for the

---------- Page 30 ----------
1999 Accident and Incident Reports
rescue operation. One caver went back into the cave alone to
take a stretcher, some supplies, and a cave radio unit to the
accident site. The other two went to the village of Tepepa in
the middle of the night to ask for help, and then returned to the
base camp where they established a base station site for the
cave radio system. Communication with the accident site was
established at about 5:15 a.m.
At 6:00 a.m. on 24 December, an expedition member left
base camp and went to the nearest village with a working
telephone, which was about two hours away. There she
encountered a group of seven cavers on their way to join the
expedition. They tried unsuccessfully to reach a number of
cave rescue contacts and organizations in the USA and
Mexico, before finally reaching Michel Cadieux of the SQS in
Quebec. Cadieux alerted authorities and cave rescue groups,
including the Canadian Embassy in Mexico City, the Mexican
Red Cross, and the NCRC. Members of these groups
coordinated their efforts and worked through the night and the
next day to develop a response and get the necessary
equipment and personnel to the cave.
Meanwhile, the caver who had carried the stretcher and
supplies to the accident site went searching for the missing
pair from the initial group. They had been stranded by
flooding, and had spent the previous 18 hours on a ledge in the
stream passage waiting for the flood to subside. Informed of
the accident, they accompanied the others back to the bivouac
site established for Goupil.
On the surface, a large-scale rescue response was building,
and by 25 December rescuers, soldiers, government officials,
and spectators had begun to arrive. Very few of the would-be
rescuers had any caving experience, and even fewer had any
experience in deep vertical caves and European-style rigging.
A member of the SQS expedition entered the cave to take
supplies to the in-cave camp, including a sleeping bag and
mattress for Goupil.
Rescue operations were complicated by language and
cultural issues, and by the lack of experienced cavers and
appropriate equipment. On 26 December, a Red Cross
physician was eventually escorted into the cave and down to
the camp, where he examined Goupil and determined that he
had no broken bones. He administered injections of anti-
inflammatory and analgesic medications to help alleviate pain
and swelling from the soft tissue injuries.
On 27 December, a group of SQS cavers arrived from
Quebec. Other cavers had also arrived, and several teams
entered the cave to begin rigging haul systems at the pits and
to carry a stretcher to Goupil. Progress was slowed by lack of
equipment and the inexperience of many of the rescuers with
vertical caving. Two Red Cross rescuers got separated from
the group and were lost for several hours. At about 8:30 p.m.,
rescuers began moving Goupil toward the entrance.
By 28 December, the rescuers were making progress
toward the entrance, and Goupil had recovered enough to get
out of the stretcher and walk through some easy sections on
his own. He was still not able to climb the pits, however, and
had to be hauled up.
Early on 29 December, Goupil was raised up two pits in
the stretcher, and was then able to get out and squeeze through
a narrow section on his own. He felt well enough to suggest
that he could use his seat harness to be hauled up the next drop
without the stretcher. The group received word that there were
no more fresh rescuers on the surface to come in, and that they
would have to wait 24 hours before continuing. Rather than
spend another night in the cave, Goupil convinced the cavers
with him that he could continue without the stretcher. After a
meal, four cavers helped him continue the ascent through the
night and the next morning. They reached the surface at 1:00
p.m.
Goupil and Michau were taken to a hospital for treatment.
Michau's ankle was found to be badly sprained, with torn
ligaments. It was placed in a cast, and later required surgery.
Goupil was treated for contusions and infected lacerations.
Upon returning to Quebec, he was diagnosed with a dorsal
sprain, a crushed vertebral disc, and torn muscles in his back.
Alain Goupil, "Rescue in the Sierra Negra, Canadian Caver,
v30n2, June 2000, p. 6.
Comments: The six-day multi-national rescue effort was
complicated beyond description. The interested reader will
enjoy Goupil's account. Of particular note is the successful
use of the Nicola Cave Radio system, developed in France and
loaned to the SQS expedition. Once the base station was set up
on the surface and a unit carried to the accident site, two-way
voice communication was available on demand, helping to
coordinate operations, simplify logistics, and dispel confusion
and uncertainty. Effective communication is invaluable in
serious cave rescue operations. Note that Michau was injured
while rushing to his friend's aid. Remember that a rescuer's
first responsibility is to himself, for his own safety. Try not to
complicate things by getting yourself hurt, too.

Boy Scout Cave, Florida
stranded, hypothermia
Michael Sharrow (15) and Javarick Henderson (16) were
exploring Boy Scout Cave with a group of six other boys and
two counselors from nearby San Antonio Boys Village when
Henderson became stuck at a hairpin curve in a small
crawlway. Sharrow went to help him, but lost consciousness.
Their companions were unable to get them out and called for
help. Rescuers worked for more than two hours to squeeze
into the passage and pull the boys out. Both were taken to a
hospital and treated for hypothermia.

Comments: Aughey reports that the cave temperature is 72
degrees Fahrenheit, and that it is a dry cave not known to have
any problems with low oxygen or bad air. Landt reports that
the two counselors were not in the cave with the boys because
"they were too big." He also notes that a campfire was
reportedly involved, but it is not clear whether they group built
a fire in the cave or outside the entrance. Even outside, it
could have been a problem if the cave was breathing in. It is
not wise to build fires in or near caves.

Queen Blair Cave, Indiana
lost, stranded, intoxication, inexperience
A man and a woman (ages unknown) arrived at the
parking area for King Blair and Queen Blair Caves around
midnight on New Years Eve wanting to go caving. They spoke
with a local resident, who noticed their obvious intoxication
and advised them against going into the caves. They
encountered another group headed for Queen Blair Cave and
decided to tag along. A few hours later, the other party exited
without the inebriated couple. When the neighbors noticed that
their truck was still in the parking area at noon, they became
concerned and decided to report the incident.
Cave rescue personnel conducted a search of Queen Blair
Cave and soon found the two. They were out of water, almost
out of light, and almost out of vodka. They had been drinking
water from the cave, and had burned some of their clothing in
an attempt to "stay warm." The fire had produced a large
amount of smoke in the cave. Rescuers led the two spelunkers,
from the cave.

Cave after an otherwise uneventful tour when they arrived at
the Up and Down Room near the entrance. They used a
handline to descend about 16 feet down a muddy flowstone
slope to the bottom of the room. Greg Denker, who had been
to the cave many times before and was the most experienced
caver in the group, spotted the others as they made the eight-
foot climb up to a crawl leading to the entrance room. He
warned them to be careful on the climb, since tired cavers
sometimes slipped there, almost at the cave entrance.
After escorting the group through the crawl, Denker went
back to retrieve the rope. He descended into the Up and Down
Room, climbed the flowstone slope, and removed the rope. He
then elected to make the Balcony Traverse around the top of
the room rather than repeating the climbs. As he stepped
across the top of the eight-foot climb, his foot slipped and he
fell, breaking his tibia and fibula as well as some ankle bones.
The other cavers came to Denker's aid. Upon
consideration of the nature of his injuries, they decided to call
for help. Rescue personnel responded, and Denker was placed
in a litter, hauled up the climb, and carried from the cave to a
waiting ambulance.
Rebecca O'Sullivan, Incident report, 8 May 2003.
Comments: O'Sullivan notes that some cavers make the
step-across without protection, while others use a spotter or rig
the climb with a rope or ladder. A belay or some form of
protection is advisable when you are at risk of falling more
that a body-length.


********** 9 January
Emisine Cave, Hawaii
cut by sharp rock
Rene Rogers (24) was in a survey party as with a group of
cavers working in Emisine Cave when her arm brushed
against a sharp piece of lava projecting up from the cave floor,
resulting in a 1.2-inch-long laceration. Her surveying partner,
Marc Ohms, applied direct pressure for several minutes and
was able to slow the bleeding. He then fashioned a temporary
bandage using a plastic bag and some duct tape. The pair then
went to find another survey party which they knew had a first
aid kit. Cindy Heazlit used the kit to clean and bandage the
wound. The cavers then resumed their survey work, and exited
as scheduled.
Marc Ohms, Incident report, 11 April 2000.
Comments: Duct tape once again proves to be the Caver's
Friend. Carrying a basic first aid kit is always a good idea.


********** 12 February
Cemetery Pit, Georgia
stranded on rope, sharing equipment
Jordan (male, last named unknown) was a member of a
group of 13 cavers visiting Cemetery Pit when he became
stranded on rope in the 153-foot entrance pit. Several
members of the group, including Jordan, did not have their
own vertical equipment, SO some members of the group were
sharing gear. Jordan was using a makeshift rig assembled from
borrowed gear which did not fit him correctly.
Soon after he started climbing, Jordan began having
difficulty with the unfamiliar system. First, the bungee cord on
his foot ascender broke. Next, the chest harness loosened and
dropped down to his waist. He was using a two-ascender
ropewalker system and did not have a third ascender or quick-
attach safety ascender to allow him to stop and rest
comfortably or fix the problems. When he became exhausted
from his struggles, he was stranded on rope mid-way up the
pit and began calling for help. As his strength ebbed, he was in
danger of becoming inverted in his harness.
A caver rappelled down on another rope and held Jordan
upright while another caver lowered a replacement chest
harness. Another of the cavers waiting at the top of the pit had
two pulleys in his pack, which the cavers used to set up a 3:1
Z-rig haul system. They were then able to pull the exhausted
caver out of the pit.
1. Don Hunter, Incident report, 13 February 2000.
2. Lori Schultz, Incident report, 20 February 2000.

---------- Page 32 ----------
2000 Accident and Incident Reports
Comments: Each caver should have his or her own set of
vertical gear. Raising and lowering shared gear at a pit is not
wise, especially in a deep pit with multiple ledges, such as
Cemetery Pit.
Every vertical caver should carry a quick-attach safety
ascender while on rope, and know how to use it to negotiate
lips and re-belays, change-over between ascent and descent, or
to provide security while addressing an equipment problem.
This is, in fact, one of the defining characteristics of an
experienced and competent vertical caver. Carrying a couple
of pulleys along for emergencies is also a good idea. The Z-rig
is a simple and effective haul system requiring minimal
equipment. Competent vertical cavers know how to build and
use it.


********** 12 February
Indian Grave Point Cave, Tennessee
stranded in pit, descended hand-over-hand
A male caver named Brian (last name unknown) became
stranded after descending a small pit in the cave hand-over-
hand. His companions called for help and cave rescue teams
were summoned. Brian was soon extracted from the pit, and
was able to exit the cave with minimal assistance
Brian Krebs, Incident report, 1 March 2000.
Comments: Krebs notes that the caving party had minimal
experience and lacked proper caving equipment.


********** 12 February
Sloans Valley Cave, Kentucky
stuck in crevice
Neil Tunison (47) was in Sloans Valley Cave with a group
of about 20 Boy Scouts and 15 adults when his leg became
wedged in a crevice. When efforts to free him failed, members
of the party left the cave to call for help. Rescuers tied a rope
around his leg and used a crowbar to lift and extract it from
the crevice. Tunison suffered a hyper-extended knee and some
bruising, but was otherwise unharmed.
Cindi Andrews, "Engineer returns after caving mishap,"
Cincinnati Enquirer, 15 February 2000.
Comments: Some would say that there were far too many
people on this trip. At least there were enough adults to
supervise the kids. One wonders how many of them were
experienced cavers.


********** 16 February
Jennings Cave, Florida
stranded in pit, inadequate equipment
Chris Sullivan (12) went exploring in Jennings Cave on a
Wednesday afternoon with several friends. Most of the others
had been to the cave before, but Sullivan had not. The youths
were equipped with flashlights and some rope, but lacked
proper caving equipment and training.
The boys descended the 20-foot entrance pit hand-over-
hand and spend about 90 minutes exploring the cave at the
bottom. When they were ready to leave, Sullivan, who
reportedly weighed in excess of 200 pounds, found that he
could not make the climb out. His friends went for help, and
Sullivan was soon rescued by members of the fire department.
He was tired and scared, but unharmed.

Rattling Cave, Tennessee
difficulty on rope
Eric Britzke (27), a graduate student conducting research
on bats, visited Rattling Cave along with companion Steve
Reis to conduct a census of the cave's Gray Bat colony. It was
Britzke's first visit to the cave, which has a 133-foot entrance
pit. Britzke had difficulty climbing back up the pit and became
exhausted. Reis, a longtime caver who often assists
researchers on such projects, went for help. By the time he
returned, Britzke had recovered and managed to complete his
ascent to the surface.
"Tired student manages to climb out of Cocke [County]
cave, Knoxville News-Sentinel, 18 February 2000.
Comments: The nature of the difficulty was not explained.
Cavers, including bat researchers, should practice and develop
their vertical skills above ground before descending 133-foot
pits. It's also a good idea to have a few more experienced
cavers on hand to help out when novice cavers are in the
group, especially when rope work is involved


********** 26 February
Grassy Cove Saltpeter Cave, Tennessee

Cass Cave, West Virginia
flood entrapment
Kevin Psarianos, Bill Murray, Diane Reichert, Ralph
Johnson, and Mike Shaw entered Cass Cave at about 11:30
a.m., expecting to be in the cave about 8 to 12 hours. The cave
consists of an entrance stream passage, part of which is a
crawl, followed by a vertical drop and lower passages. Rain
was forecast for the area, but the group believed that flooding
was not a problem at Cass.
When the group attempted to exit the cave at about 9:30
p.m., they found that the stream crawl leading to the entrance
was flooded. They set up a bivouac, placed markers to monitor
the water level and waited for the water to recede. Eventually,
the flood subsided and they were able to get through the crawl.
They were then stopped by a 10-foot climb near the entrance
with high water flowing across it. Once again they settled
down to wait.
When they missed their call-in time of 8:00 a.m. Sunday, a
group conducting a nearby NCRC training class went to check
on the overdue cavers. Finding their car still at the entrance
and high water flowing into the cave, the rescuers mobilized
for a search along with Cass Fire and Rescue. As rescuers
entered the cave, they met one of the missing cavers, who had
managed to get up the climb and make his way out of the
cave. The rescuers entered the cave, hauled the remaining
cavers up the 10-foot drop, and escorted them from the cave.
The cavers were out by 1:30 p.m. on March 12.

Allentown Grotto Pack Rat Scat, n77, Spring 2000.
3. Kevin Psarianos, "Cass Cave Rescue," West Virginia
Caver, v18n3, June 2000, p. 7.
Comments: [by Kevin Psarianos] This was a good day to
pick another cave. The cave does have some potential for
flooding and a similar incident occurred once before. The
entrance passage is fed by a reasonably large and steep
drainage basin, making it subject to flash-flooding. Likewise
the weather forecast that morning indicated rain with a
possibility of heavy rain.
It was an experienced party that discussed flooding
potential both before the trip and as they entered the cave. Yet
they perceived the risks as acceptable and chose to continue.
This was clearly a mistake, and a more conservative decision
would have been appropriate.
On a positive note, the preset call-in and the group's
actions once the problem presented itself resulted in no
injuries.


********** 15 March
J-4 Cave, Pennsylvania
caver fall
A female caver fell while climbing the Formation Climb
and landed on her back. She was briefly unconscious, but soon
recovered and felt that she was not seriously injured. Her
companions rigged a haul line, gave her a seat harness, and
pulled her to the top of the climb. She was then able to make
her way out of the cave. She was driven to a hospital, where
she was examined and released. She suffered only bruises.

Birds Drop, Virginia
fatality, caver fall, no safety at pit lip
Paul David Snowburg (41) of Fort Chiswell, Virginia, was
killed when he fell down the 150-foot entrance shaft of Birds
Drop. Snowburg was accompanied by two teenagers, and had
previously visited another nearby cave. The entrance, which is
surrounded by a fence, is a sink which drops about 20 feet to a
large ledge, followed by a drop of about 140 feet to a large
room. Snowburg reportedly tied a flashlight to a rope and was
lowering it down the shaft when he fell in. He was killed
instantly. His body was recovered by rescue personnel.
1. Doug Moore, "Cave Rescues, "West Virginia Caver,

2. Paul Montgomery, Incident report, 17 March 2000.
Comments: Apparently, Snowburg was not affiliated with
any organized caving groups or experienced cavers, and was
not aware of proper safety procedures. Persons working within
a body-length of the edge of a drop should always be wearing
a harness and be belayed or rigged in to a solidly anchored
caving rope.


********** 24 March
Doe Mountain Cave, Virginia
caver fall, dislocated shoulder
Steve Wells and Steve La Pera entered Doe Mountain
Cave on Friday evening to push to the top of the Mega Dome.
About 100 feet up the infeeder going to the dome, Wells
slipped and fell backwards a few feet into a crevice,
dislocating his shoulder.
The pair spent several hours trying to reduce or secure
Wells' shoulder SO that he could exit the cave, but were finally
forced to give up. At about 5:00 a.m., La Pera started out of
the cave to get help. At 8:00 a.m., he reached the home of Bill
Balfour, who called in several other cavers, including two with
EMT training, and formed an initial response team to start into
the cave.
The rescue group entered at about 10:00 a.m. carrying food
and medical supplies. They reached Wells just before noon,
provided him with food and medication, and were able to
reduce his dislocation. After that, Wells was able to make his
way out of the cave. He reached the surface at about 6:00 p.m.

rope. They had no caving experience and no proper
equipment. The men tied knots in the rope and descended
hand-over-hand, expecting to climb out in the same fashion.
Cooper eventually managed to make the ascent, and went to
summon help for the stranded Davis. Members of the Jackson

the Jackson County Rescue Squad, was quoted in the news
accounts, saying, "It was just pure stupidity on any grown
person to go into a situation like that. It's a wonder either of
them made it out." Hastings also commented, "They had no

previous visit by a 30-foot pit about 100 feet into the cave.
This time they brought a rope and intended to continue their
exploration.
Using seat harnesses tied from short pieces of rope,
Gamble, Keith, and Campbell descended. Brown decided to
wait at the top. After a look around, the three tried to climb
out. Using knots and loops tied in the rope, Campbell was able
to climb out. Keith and Gamble, however, were not able to
make the climb. Brown and Campbell tried to pull their
companions up, but the small passage hampered their efforts,

decided to go out and get help.
The cave rescue team was called at about 4:00 a.m. on
Easter Sunday morning, and arrived at the cave about an hour
later. Poor rock near the pit prevented the rescuers from
setting additional anchors and rigging a haul system, SO the
knotted rope was replaced with a proper caving rope and a
rescuer descended with extra climbing systems, showed the
stranded pair how to don and use the equipment, and
supervised as they climbed out on their own. The stranded
cavers reached the surface at about 9:00 a.m.
Buddy Lane, Incident report, 28 April 2000.
Comments: The teenagers had no training or experience
and lacked proper caving equipment including helmets, seat

temperatures. Three of the families of the kids reportedly
knew of their plans, and allowed them to go.


********** 29 April
Climax Cave, Georgia
histoplasmosis
Paul Aughey, Alan Cressler, David Cole, Doug Strait,
Keith Henry, and Brent Aulenbach visited Climax Cave,
planning to tour most of the known passages, including the
south section of the cave, which is home to a large bat colony.
They did not plan to traverse the area used by the bats.
When they reached the Dream Room, however, they
discovered that the bats had relocated and taken up residence
in that part of the cave, blocking their intended route. They
found themselves in a hands-and-knees crawlway in 8 to 10
inches of fresh guano, with a strong odor of ammonia. All of
the cavers found themselves sweating and breathing hard.
Suspecting bad air, they decided to turn back after about 30
feet.
Retreating from the bat-filled passage, they left the
southern section of the cave and spent the remainder of their
time touring the northern portions without incident. About ten
days after the trip, Strait, Cressler, and Aulenbach developed
persistent coughs and fevers, and sought medical treatment for
histoplasmosis. Aughey also reported symptoms including
shortness of breath. All of the cavers recovered from the
illness, and none required hospitalization
Paul Aughey, "Histo Alert!" Tag-Net Digest 2144, 11 May
2000.
Comments: Histoplasmosis has been contracted by cavers
visiting Climax Cave on several previous occasions. In most
cases, the affected cavers had visited the south section of the
cave, which harbors a large bat colony. The cavers on this trip
were aware of this, and did not intend to enter the bat roost
area. That did not help them, however, when they encountered
the bats in an unexpected location. One must consider the risk
associated with visiting caves or passages known to harbor the
Histoplasma capsulatum fungus.

0-9 Well, Texas
caver fall, broken ankle
Ken Kamon was the last person down a drop in the cave,

realized he was off-route and about 30 feet above the other
cavers. As he made his way down, he slipped, slid about ten
feet, and then fell through a hole and down another 20 feet
before coming to rest. He was briefly stunned by the fall, and
found that he had injured his right ankle.
Kamon was able to make his way out of the cave, climbing
pits of 40 and 90 feet using his left leg. Believing the ankle to
be merely sprained, he did not seek medical treatment until
nine days after the accident. A visit to the doctor revealed that
he had in fact broken his leg in several places.

********** 27 June
Fieldhouse Cave, West Virginia
caver fall from ladder, no belay
Ed Lucas, Angela Lucas, and Dave Jewel left the 2000
NSS Convention to visit Fieldhouse Cave. As they prepared to
enter the cave, another group of five cavers from the
convention arrived, led by Bill Biggers. Lucas's group rigged
a rope in the 17-foot entrance pit, which is followed by a short
slope and another 10-foot drop.
The Lucas group rappelled in and went off to explore the
cave. The Biggers group rigged the entrance with a cable
ladder and a belay line and used the ladder to descend and
enter the cave.
When the two groups began exiting the cave, Biggers
found that he was unable to complete the ladder climb to the
surface, apparently lacking the strength to pull himself over
the lip at the top. He climbed back down, but became snagged
when one of the speed lace hooks on his boots became caught
in the cable ladder.
One of the members of his group tried to steady Biggers
while another worked to free the snag. Biggers lost his grip
and fell from the ladder, knocking one of the cavers against
the wall and landing on top of the other. Fortunately, no one
was injured by the fall. Lucas and companions then climbed
out of the pit and belayed the other cavers as they climbed the
ladder. Several needed help getting over the lip, but all
eventually reached the surface safely.
Ed Lucas, Incident report, 15 November 2000.
Comments: Climbing a cable ladder is not as simple as one
might think. It requires significant upper body strength-more
than that required for prusikking-especially when climbing a
free-hanging ladder or negotiating a difficult lip. A belay
should always be used for cable ladder climbs and descents.
Biggers had no belay because he was the first to climb, and
he had not rigged the belay SO that it could be used from below
for the first caver up. With proper rigging, the last climber
down and the first climber up the ladder can also enjoy the
security of a belay. Most US cavers favor the use of single
rope techniques over ladders, even for short drops. If you're
going to use cable ladders, learn to rig and use the "slingshot"
bottom belay and the self-belay, as well as the standard belay.

********** 12 August
Clarks Cave, Virginia
caver fall, dislocated shoulder
Kristen McCombs (29), Toby Joy (29), and Mike Peery
entered Clarks Cave at about 2:00 p.m., and were about one
hour into the cave when Joy stepped down off of a rock and
lost his footing. He attempted to catch himself with his right
hand, but the force of the fall caused the posterior dislocation
of his right shoulder. McCombs and Peery used some webbing
to fashion a sling for Joy's arm with webbing. Once the
injured arm had been immobilized, they assisted Joy in exiting
the cave. The trip out took about three hours.
At the entrance, the webbing was replaced by a sling made
from a knee pad and pack straps. The webbing was then used
to attach Joy to Perry SO that Peery could assist him up the
steep slope to the cars. The ascent of the slope took another
hour. Joy was then taken to the local hospital in Hot Springs
were he was treated for the dislocation.
Kristen McCombs, Incident report, 8 September 2000.
Comments: The group showed good initiative and
resourcefulness in executing a self-rescue. As a result, Joy
reached the hospital much sooner than he probably would
have if the group had sent for help and awaited its arrival. Joy
had previously dislocated the shoulder while playing football
12 years earlier.


********** 12 August
Wind-Ice Cave, Wyoming
stranded, inadequate equipment
Four men in their 20s were rescued from the cave after
becoming stranded when they were unable to find the route
through to the lower Wind Cave entrance during a pull-down
trip through the cave. They entered the upper Ice Cave
entrance at about noon on Saturday, and rappelled four drops
to reach the middle section of the cave. When they reached a
wet section which required wading through cold, waist-deep
pools, they decided they were in over their heads and turned
around.
The men made it back up two of the drops, but could not
climb the longest drop in the cave-a 50-foot ice-covered pit.
Stranded, they waited for rescue, which came late Sunday
afternoon after they were reported overdue. Rescuers entered
the cave and rigged the first two drops, finding the men
waiting at the bottom. They were able to climb out on their
own, but lacked crampons and required assistance through the
ice-coated entrance passages in order to exit the cave.

Jackson Hole News, 16 August 2000, p. 8A.
Comments: The cave has been the scene of several similar
rescues in recent years. The middle section of the cave is
complex, and cavers are advised to go in the company of
someone familiar with the connection route.


********** 15 August
talus cave at Pine Mountain, New Hampshire
stuck
Andrea Davis (15) was attending a church camp and was a
member of a group of campers who set out on a caving trip at
about 2:00 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon. The group was
exploring several small talus caves near the base of Pine
Mountain when Davis' left leg became wedged in a crevice.
When her companions were unable to help her get free, they
called for help.
Firefighters and other emergency services personnel spent
the night drilling, chiseling, and chipping away at the granite
in order to free Davis. She was finally released after about 12
hours in the cave. She suffered no injuries from her
entrapment.

help, and encountered a group of Esso Grotto members at the
entrance, where they were working on a project to remove an
old gate from the cave. The grotto members, along with a
group of Boy Scouts who were also engaged in clean-up and
conservation work at the cave, carried the woman out of the
cave, and her husband drove her to a hospital for treatment.

********** 16 September
Great Saltpeter Cave, Kentucky
struck by thrown cyalume stick
During a cavers' gathering at Great Saltpeter Cave, a
group decided to tour the cave using cyalume light sticks
rather than conventional caving lights. The cave has been used
as a social gathering place for many decades and is a former
show cave, with large easy passages and flat floors.
When the group reached the Big Room, some cavers were
playing with their light sticks, swinging, twirling, and tossing
them about the room. Stephanie Caldwell (32) was injured
when she tossed her light stick into the air, missed her catch,
and was struck in the eye. The next morning, she noticed that
her eye had been bleeding, and applied antibiotic eye drops.
She later sought medical treatment.
Sandy Rice, Incident report, 24 September 2000.
Comments: Playing catch in the dark cave environment is
probably not a good idea.


********** 30 September
0-9 Well, Texas
fatality, caver fall, belay system failed
Joe Ivy (35) and Tim Stich entered O-9 Well in the
company of 16 fellow cavers. They descended the 127-foot
entrance drop and five more pits to reach a large room with a
high dome at the bottom of the cave, where they had been
working on a bolt climb. Their goal was to reach an apparent
infeeding passage visible about 165 feet off the floor. On their
previous trip, the pair had left a fixed line for their return.
The climbers used a belay system comprised of a Kong
Slyde shock-absorbing device anchored to two bolts and
attached to a 9-millimeter static caving rope. They had used
this arrangement on their previous trips, attaching themselves
to the end of the 9-millimeter line with their climbing system
ascenders after climbing the fixed line to their previous high
point. The arrangement allowed the lead climber to self-belay
as he worked, and had held two falls on the initial trip.
For belay anchors and fall protection, they employed a
combination of fixed expansion bolts and a new device called
a "removable bolt." The removable bolt is a spring-loaded
camming device that is inserted into a standard expansion bolt
hole, but can be removed and re-used during the climb. It is
available in various sizes, including 1/4-inch and 3/8-inch
versions. On a previous trip, Stich had fallen when a 1/4-inch
removable bolt pulled out unexpectedly, SO they had decided
to use only the 3/8-inch size. Their normal practice was to
alternate placing removable bolts and fixed expansion bolts,
never placing two removable bolts in a row.
Ivy took his belay and bolting equipment and climbed to
the top of the fixed line, where he set up his belay system. He
attached himself to the 9-millimeter static line with the Croll
ascender on his seat harness, and began working on the climb.
He climbed about 20 feet before deciding to come down to
take a break and eat while Stich took a turn.
Stich ascended the fixed line and then switched to the 9-
millimeter rope, belaying himself in the same fashion as Ivy
had. It was his practice to attach both of his ascenders to the
belay line rather than just the Croll, as Ivy usually did.
Continuing the climb, Stich placed bolts and moved up until
he reached a point about 15 feet below the passage that was
their destination. He did not have enough bolt hangers to
complete the climb and had become tired, SO he decided to go
down. He set two bolts to anchor the fixed line and descended,
removing hangers and carabiners from the bolts below.
On bottom, Stich gave the bolting equipment and hardware
to Ivy, and informed him that the belay rope might not reach
to the top of the climb. Ivy coiled an extra rope and attached it
to his to his harness, then climbed up the fixed line. He soon
disappeared from view. As Stich waited below, he could hear
other cavers from the group approaching, and could see the
dim glow of Ivy's headlamp far above.
After some time, Stich heard what sounded like a brief
exclamation from Ivy, followed by a loud, resounding crash.
Stich called up to Ivy, but heard no response. He could no
longer see Ivy's light above him. One of the approaching
cavers, Sarah Springer, heard Stich shouting and called out to
him. Stich told her that they needed help, and Springer passed
the word to others in the group, who started for the surface.

---------- Page 39 ----------
2000 Accident and Incident Reports
By this time, Stich could hear Ivy moaning somewhere
above. He donned his climbing gear and started up the fixed
line. He found Ivy wedged in a slot in the wall about 100 feet
off the floor. He had apparently fallen somewhere between 40
and 60 feet, hit a steep, sloping ledge, and become wedged in
a slot above a muddy ramp.
Stich climbed above the slot and then climbed down to
reach Ivy. He immediately noticed that Ivy was not attached to
any rope. Fearing that Ivy might come out of the slot and fall
to the floor, Stich quickly tied a loop in the rope below himself
and attached it to Ivy's harness. Ivy was conscious but clearly
had serious injuries. He told Stich that he couldn't breathe,
and that his arm hurt. Stich could not pull Ivy out of the slot,
but was able to move him down the top of the muddy ramp
below, where a small ledge allowed him to gain purchase
while he tried to tend to Ivy.
It appeared that Ivy's difficulty breathing was being
caused by his harness, which had ridden up around his chest.
The harness was a butt-strap design of Ivy's own making, and
did not have a strap between the legs to prevent it from riding
up. When he was unable to remove or loosen the harness,
Stich realized he had to get Ivy down as quickly as possible.
Unfortunately, the rope had become wedged in some
chockstones as Stich had climbed down to reach Ivy. Not
realizing the situation, Springer had gotten on rope below and
was climbing up to assist. Stich called down to her and told
her to get off the rope, but she was too high up, and did not
know how to change to rappel. She climbed up to the slot,
where Stich helped her get onto the ledge and attach herself to
the rope above Ivy, who had lost consciousness, but was still
breathing. They tried to pull him up out of the slot and onto
the ledge, but were unsuccessful.
Stich pulled the rope down from the chockstones, got
himself out of the slot and prepared to rappel to the floor with
Ivy below him, attaching his cow's tail from his own harness
to Ivy's. By this time it had become apparent that Ivy was no
longer breathing. Stich maneuvered him out of the slot and
rappelled to the bottom.
He was met there by Charley Savvas and Frank Delgado,
who had come to help. Savvas had a knife, and they used it to
cut Ivy's harness loose. They administered CPR, but could not
revive him. More cavers arrived with a Sked litter and other
rescue gear. Working late into the night, the cavers moved
Ivy's body up four rope drops and through the cave to the
bottom of the second drop before becoming exhausted. They
left the cave at 3:00 a.m. to get some rest. A fresh team
entered on the following day, and Ivy's body was recovered
from the cave at about 4:00 p.m.

Comments: The above summary is taken from a detailed
report and analysis prepared by Peter Sprouse and others
involved in the investigation of the accident. Following a
description the events of the 30 September trip and an
extensive discussion of the climbing techniques and
equipment used, the report offers some possible scenarios for
the accident and the group's conclusions as to its causes.
No one knows exactly what happened at the top of the
climb to cause Ivy's fall, but it is thought that he had placed
one or possibly two anchors before falling. Whether the fall
was precipitated by a removable bolt pulling out of its hole is
unknown, but the earlier incident suggests that it is a good
possibility. The muddy cave environment is known to interfere
with the operation and security of spring-loaded camming
devices of the type used in climbing.
When Ivy fell, his belay system suffered a severe shock
load. As the system tried to absorb the load, his climbing
harness was pulled up around his chest, where it later
interfered with his breathing. When the energy of the fall
exceeded the amount that the belay system could absorb, the
Croll ascender stripped the sheath from the 9-millimeter rope
and cut through the core. The belay rope was severed, and Ivy
fell more than 40 feet. As he fell he struck the wall and landed
in the slot, sustaining major injuries to his head, neck, back,
arms, and internal organs.
Investigators believe that Ivy had moved the Slyde belay
device up to the higher anchor close to the top of the climb.
This meant that there was less rope between the belay anchor
and the falling climber, increasing the severity of the shock
load on the belay system. The use of 9-millimeter static caving
rope as a belay line rather than the more typical 10-millimeter
or 11-millimeter dynamic climbing rope also significantly
reduced the system's ability to absorb the shock of the fall.
The use of a mechanical ascender to attach the lead
climber to the belay line was also significant. Ascenders have
been known to damage and even cut ropes under high static
loads, and have been demonstrated to cut ropes when shock-
loaded, as is the case in a lead fall. They should not be used as
belay devices.
The conclusions from the published accident report are
worth repeating:
"A mechanical ascender should never be used as a primary
part of a belaying system, no matter how many subsequent
devices are added to absorb the energy of falls. Dynamic rope
of 10-millimeter or larger diameter should always be used for
belaying leader climbs; static rope is unacceptable."
"RBs, if used at all, should be used with extreme caution,
as they seem to perform poorly under the often wet/muddy
conditions of a cave."
"The fact that some falls of lesser force had occurred
before the accident led the climbers to feel that the belay
system was adequate, however these falls were too few to
actually validate the technique. Planning an ascender belay
that was believed would 'only' result in the stripping of the
rope sheath was poor judgment from the start. Joe's death was
due to his own actions and the judgments he made in
designing his belaying system. No piece of gear failed in a
way that was not known to happen. The belaying system
design was perilously flawed in that it did not allow for the
force of a fall factor 2 fall. A belay system should be designed
to handle the maximum fall possible, which is an FF2 fall. The
good performance of the belaying system on gentler falls prior
to the fatal fall helped foster a sense of complacency in the
climbers. Overconfidence kept them from continually
questioning their system and methods."

********** 19 October
Mammoth Cave, Kentucky
lost, stranded
Richard Swerling (55) of Baltimore, Maryland, traveled to
Fort Knox with his daughter to see his son-in-law graduate
from boot camp. On Thursday, October 19th, he told his
daughter that he was going to take a cave tour in the park and
do some hiking on Friday and that he'd be back later the same
day. When he failed to return that evening, his daughter
reported him missing.
Rangers were notified by military police at Fort Knox and
found Swerling's vehicle in the visitor center parking lot. They
determined that he'd purchased a ticket for an 11 a.m. Grand
Avenue cave tour and that he should have been out of the cave
by 3:00 p.m. After confirming that he was not staying at the
campground or hotel, rangers began searching all the trails in
the headquarters area and a portion of the Green River. No
sign of him was found.
While rangers brought in search dogs and continued their
surface search, Swerling was found in the cave by members of
the Saturday Grand Avenue tour group. He said that he'd
fallen behind his tour group the day before while taking
pictures; before he could catch up with them, the lights went
out. Since he had no flashlight or other light source, he
decided to remain at that location and wait for the next tour to
come through. Swerling spent the next 24 hours in total
blackness by himself, since only one Grand Avenue tour is
scheduled each day.
Swerling said that the 54 degree cave temperature was not
a problem because he had warm clothing on, but that he sang
every song he knew in order to cope with the darkness and
isolation.

********** 3 December
Snail Shell Cave, Tennessee
stranded, hypothermia, inadequate equipment
Tony Jones (22), Joe Carpenter (24), and Kyle McDonald
(23) entered the downstream section of Snail Shell Cave at
about 2:00 p.m. on Sunday afternoon, wearing jeans and
sweatshirts, and carrying inner tubes to use in crossing deep
pools found in the cave. Each one was equipped with a life
jacket, a paddle, a helmet, and a single light, with no back-up
lights.
The trio made their way down a passage until they reached
a 20-foot drop, where they rigged a knotted piece of
inexpensive nylon cord. They tossed their inner tubes down
the drop to a deep pool at the bottom, and then lowered
themselves hand-over-hand.
The men paddled around and explored to the end of the
passage, where they could not find any way onward. Paddling
back to their rope, they quickly discovered that they were
unable to climb back up the 20-foot drop. Eventually, Jones
managed to haul himself up and went out to get help for the
others.
Rescuers entered the cave at about 8:40 p.m. and reached
the stranded men, who were sitting on a ledge out of the water,
at about 9:00 p.m. The rescuers rigged a haul system and
lowered climbing harness to the two men as they prepared to
haul them up the pit. When the men were unable to figure out
how to don the harnesses, a rescuer rappelled down to assist.
The men were then quickly hauled up the drop and escorted
from the cave. They were taken to a hospital, where one of the
men was treated for hypothermia, fatigue, and dehydration.

********** 9 December
Pink Lime Pit, Utah
stranded on rope
Jeremy Jackson, Ralph Powers, Megan Porter, and Jacob
Snedecor, along with three other cavers, went to Pink Lime Pit
to practice single rope techniques. Three of the cavers were
new to vertical caving, one caver had not been on rope in
some time, and the remaining three were experienced in rope
work.
After making several adjustments to his climbing system,
Jackson began his ascent. Apparently, the system was not
configured or functioning properly, because he was unable to
keep himself upright as he climbed. Jackson managed to climb
only about 15 feet before becoming exhausted. He then found
that he was unable to change over to rappel and get back
down.
Since there were several ropes rigged in the pit, Ralph
Powers got on another rope and climbed to try to help Jackson
perform a change-over. Jackson was too exhausted to
complete the maneuver, even with assistance, SO Powers was
forced to perform a pick-off. He attached a daisy-chain sling
between his own harness and Jackson's, then changed over to
rappel.
When they were unable to remove Jackson's ascenders
from the rope, Powers decided to cut the slings with a knife.
As he prepared to rappel, Powers discovered that he had
forgotten to remove his safety ascender from above his rappel
rack. He decided to cut that sling as well. Powers then
rappelled to the floor with Jackson hanging below him.
Once on bottom, Jackson was allowed to rest and then
fitted with Powers' double bungee climbing system. He was
then able to climb out without further assistance.
Ralph Powers, Incident report, undated.
Comments: Powers observed that Jackson lacked a proper
chest harness for his system, which caused him to waste
energy trying to hold himself upright as he climbed. Powers
also noted that he should have paid more attention to his own
change-over while helping Jackson.
When performing a pick-off, skilled cavers do not find it
necessary to cut themselves or the subject free. Using a knife
around loaded ropes is not generally advisable, and should be
a tactic of last resort.

2001 Accident and Incident Reports


********** 31 January
Sides Cave, Kentucky
caver fall
Chris Groves, Brice Leech, and Joe Meiman entered Sides
Cave at about 10:30 a.m. to retrieve dye receptors placed in
the cave on an earlier trip. The cave begins as a 10-inch high
belly-crawl over gravel and cobbles for about 50 feet,
followed by almost 1,500 feet of low lands-and-knees water
crawl. The crawl ends at a 30-foot deep pit known as Safety
Dome, which is the first point of relative safety beyond the
flood-prone crawlway. Water from the crawl cascades into the
pit, which is intersected by a tall canyon leading to the rest of
the cave.
One by one, the three cavers made their way across the pit,
crawling along a large, thick ledge on the left side, and then
climbing partway down to reach the passage below. Safely
across, they continued into the cave to retrieve the dye
receptors.
Shortly after 1:00 p.m. they were back at Safety Dome,
ready to cross the pit and make their way through the long
crawl to the entrance. Groves went first, while Leech and
Meiman waited their turns. As Groves crossed the ledge at the
top of the pit, it collapsed beneath him. Meiman heard a loud
crash and looked up in time to see Groves fall over the
waterfall and into the pit.
Meiman ran to the edge of the pit and yelled for Groves.
Looking down, he saw Groves lying face down in a pool of
water at the bottom of the pit. He quickly found a way down
and raced to Groves, pulling him form the pool. Initially,
Groves was not breathing, and water drained from his nose
and mouth, but as soon as Meiman pulled him from the pool
he started breathing and coughing. He was bleeding from a cut
under his left eye. His helmet had remained on during the fall.
Meiman called up to Leech, who was waiting at the top,
telling him that Groves was alive and that they would need
help getting out of the pit. Neither of the men had been down
the pit before, and they were not certain that it would be
possible to climb back out without a rope. Meiman checked
Groves for other obvious injuries found none. Groves was
somewhat disoriented, but gradually came to understand
where he was and what had happened. He reported that his
right side and shoulder were hurting.
Leech remembered seeing a 15-foot piece of rope back in
the cave earlier in the day, and went to retrieve it. He then
climbed down the pit to help Meiman and Groves. They tied
the rope to Groves' left arm, and Meiman climbed up to pull
from above as Leech helped Groves climb out of the pit and
chimney up into a larger side passage leading back into the
cave. The process took over an hour.
Groves felt he could make the 1,500-foot water crawl out
of the cave, but Leech and Meiman were concerned that he
might run out of energy and wind up stranded in the cold
water. In addition, there was still the matter of getting across
the top of the pit. Meiman and Leech insisted that Groves
needed to sit tight, stay warm, and wait for help. Groves was
not convinced at first, but realized that they were right when
they pointed out that it had taken over an hour just to climb
out of the pit and up to the room.
Meiman left for the entrance at 2:25 p.m., while Leech
used trash bags and candles from a cache kept in the cave to
make a heat tent to keep Groves comfortable. Meiman crossed
the pit and made it through the long crawl in 25 minutes,
reaching the surface at 2:50 p.m. His vehicle was parked
nearby, and he used his radio to report the incident to the Park
Service and request assistance.
Park personnel and volunteer cavers quickly assembled to
mount a rescue operation. Working through the evening and
into the night, rescuers brought Groves across the pit and
through the crawl, reaching the surface at about 4:00 a.m. the
next morning. He was taken to a hospital, where he was found
to have rib and shoulder fractures, as well as cuts and bruises.

Kula Kai Caverns, Hawaii
caver fall, dislocated shoulder
Rose Herrera (57) was in Kula Kai Caverns participating
in a mock-rescue training exercise as part of a weekend
Orientation to Cave Rescue Seminar. As part of the exercise, a
group of cavers was working to move a patient in a litter
through a 3-foot high passage. Herrera was one of two cavers
guiding the litter using a tag-line attached to the front. As
Herrera moved to adjust her position, a rock rolled out from
beneath her foot and she lost her balance. As she rolled to the
right, she put out her hand to catch herself. Another rock
rolled beneath her hand and she fell, landing on her arm and
shoulder. Her shoulder was dislocated in the fall.

---------- Page 42 ----------
2001 Accident and Incident Reports
Don Coons and Penelope Pooler were supervising the
exercise and saw Herrera fall. They went to her immediately,
along with Todd Vincent, another seminar participant who
was an EMT. After Herrera's injury was assessed, Pooler was
sent out of the cave to report the incident. Vincent remained
with Herrera, which Coons went outside and got Rick Bennett,
a wilderness medicine instructor.
Herrera was in severe pain, and reported that her fingers
were numb. With her consent, Bennett was able to reduce the
dislocation, which relieved most of her discomfort. Since they
had a litter already available from the exercise, they decided it
would be easiest to carry Herrera out. The trip to the surface
took about 30 minutes. Herrera was driven to a hospital for
treatment.

********** 24 February
Rattling Cave, Tennessee
caver fall, equipment failure
Raeme Prichett (34) and Michael Greene rigged the 133-
foot entrance drop to Rattling Cave. Greene descended first,
and waited at the bottom as Prichett prepared to descend. As
she started down the drop, Prichett suddenly became detached
from her rappel rack and fell down the pit. She landed on
Greene and sustained injuries including multiple fractures and
head trauma. Greene also received lesser injuries to his arm.
Greene climbed out of the pit and went for help. Rescuers
responded, placed Prichett in a litter, and hauled her out of the
pit. She was taken to the hospital for treatment and underwent
a lengthy recovery.
"Woman injured after falling in cave, Knoxville News-
Sentinel, 26 February 3001.
Comments: Prichett was using a single auto-locking
carabiner to attach her rappel rack to her seat harness. The
carabiner had a plastic locking sleeve, which reportedly broke,
allowing the gate to open and the rack to become detached
from her harness. Prichett is very fortunate to be alive.
One possible explanation is that the carabiner and the
rappel rack were in the orientation that places the eye of the
rack across the carabiner gate, allowing the loaded rack to act
as a lever and break the gate or sleeve. This can happen as a
caver crosses over a lip or ledge during descent.
Reports of similar carabiner failures were published in
World Mountaineering & Climbing 3/2000, the Journal of the
Union Internationale des Associations d' Alpinisme (UIAA).
The publication is available from the UIAA web site at
http://journal.uiaa.ch/download/20003.pdf.
Many cavers use two locking carabiners, with the gates
opposite and opposed, to attach their rappel rack to the
harness. Others prefer a maillon link similar to those used in
seat harnesses. Either method would provide better security
than a single carabiner. Auto-locking carabiners are not used
by most cavers, as the locking mechanism is prone to
malfunctions caused by the muddy, gritty cave environment.
In any event, it is always necessary to make sure that
carabiner gates are closed and securely locked, that maillon
gates are completely closed, and that the attachment link and
rappel device remain in the proper orientation during use.

Redman Cave, Arizona
fatality, drowning, inadequate equipment
Aaron Standage (25) and William Ferrin entered Redman
Cave and traveled through about 250 feet of passage before
climbing down to a lower level passage filled with water.
Hoping to get to more cave, they climbed through a 3-foot
opening into the flooded passage and swam underwater for
about ten feet before surfacing in an area with about six inches
of airspace.
After some discussion, Ferrin decided to go back the way
he had come. Standage apparently took a different route.
Ferrin reached the main passage safely, but Standage failed to
appear. As more time passed without any sign of his
companion, Ferrin became concerned and decided to go for
help.
Rescue workers reached the cave within an hour. Adam
Shepard, a diver with the Sheriff's department, entered the
passage using scuba gear and found Standage's body wedged
in a crevice about 12 feet down the flooded passage. He had
apparently drowned after losing his way. Shepard was able to
free Standage's body from the passage, and rescuers carried
him from the cave.

Rattling Cave, Tennessee
stranded in pit, exhaustion
John Baldwin and Roger Caldwell descended the 133-foot
entrance shaft of Rattling Cave to photograph the pit. They
climbed to a ledge and room about 40 feet below the lip of the
pit and spent some time taking pictures before preparing to
climb out. Baldwin then found that he was unable to make the
climb to the surface.
Caldwell climbed out, went home to get a sleeping bag and
provisions for Baldwin, and returned to the cave. Baldwin
spent the night in the pit, but was still unable to climb out the
next day. That afternoon, Caldwell decided that it was time to
get some assistance. Rescue personnel responded and hauled
Baldwin from the pit at about 7:15 p.m.

wound and close it with surgical tape and a gauze pad.
Hampton then donned his neoprene glove, which provided
further protection. They were in a comfortable passage about a
mile from the cave entrance, SO they decided to take a break
and have some hot coffee and soup and "let the adrenaline
edge smooth off" before heading out.
Rodney Tennyson, Incident report, 17 March 2001.
Comments: As Tennyson notes, slips like this happen all
the time in caving, which is why we wear gloves. When you
take them off, be sure to use extra care and watch your
footing.

stuck
Ben Spencer (13) and a fellow Boy Scout were rescued
after becoming stuck in the Birth Canal passage in Nutty Putty
Cave. The passage has been the scene of a number of similar
incidents. In this incident, Spencer became wedged in the
passage and another boy was trapped behind him.
Cavers Ralph Powers and Jon Jasper stopped by the cave
on the way home from a trip to another cave nearby and found
a rescue in progress. Being familiar with the cave and passage
from previous incidents, they were able to enter the cave and
talk to the stranded youth as he struggled in the crawl. With
advice and encouragement from Powers, the boy made it
through, though he lost his pants in the process. The other boy
was smaller, and made it through the tight passage without
difficulty. The boys were reported to have been tired and
dehydrated, but otherwise unharmed.

A male caver (mid-30's) suffered a dislocated shoulder
when he slipped and fell from a climb in a room near the Bear
Haven Entrance of Bowden Cave. He was able to reduce the
dislocation himself, and was assisted from the cave by
members of his party, two of whom had cave rescue training.
According to the report, the man had injured the shoulder prior

Blue Spring Cave, Tennessee
dislocated shoulder
Bob Richards (48) entered Blue Spring Cave at about
11:00 a.m. with four other cavers for a photography trip. They
were about 2,000 feet into the cave when Richards' shoulder
became dislocated as he reached out for a handhold while
making a short climb. Richards was in pain, and was unable to
move through the tight and narrow passages without
assistance. Several members of the party remained with him
while others went to get help.
Rescuers soon arrived at the cave and made their way to
Richards. Initial efforts to reduce the dislocation were
unsuccessful, and a full-scale rescue effort was mobilized to
carry Richards out of the cave. Eventually, however rescuers
managed to reduce the dislocation. Richards' arm was
bandaged and secured, and he was able to make his way
through the cave with assistance at tight spots, climbs, and
other obstacles. He reached the surface at about 10:30 p.m.

Resumidero La Joya, Mexico
caver fall, lost control on rappel
Martin Alvarado Ibarra (23) was an instructor with a group
of 17 cavers visiting Sotano de la Joya, a 240-meter deep cave
with rope drops of 5, 16, 8, 10, and 45 meters in depth. He was
on rappel in the final 45-meter pit and had passed a rebelay
about ten meters down when he lost control of his rappel and
started to fall.
Alvarado Ibarra was using a Dressler descender with a
shunt attached to his harness as a rappel safety. When he lost
control he let go of the shunt, which grabbed the rope. The
1/2-inch webbing he had used to attach the shunt to his
harness broke, and his uncontrolled descent continued. He fell
about 25 meters down the offset shaft of the pit, striking the
wall once before coming to rest at the bottom. An initial
examination suggested that he had fractured his ankle, pelvis,
and ribs, in addition to multiple contusions.
A large-scale rescue effort was mobilized to bring
Alvarado Ibarra up the five drops and through more than 1,500
meters of passage to reach the surface. Cavers and emergency
services personnel worked through the day and night on
Sunday, and Alvarado Ibarra reached the surface at about 7:30
a.m. Monday morning.

Comments: The Dressler descender is a type of bobbin. It
was not clear why Alvarado Ibarra lost control, but one report
indicated that he may not have been using the extra control
carabiner often used with such devices to add friction. The
webbing used to attach the shunt to the harness was apparently
not strong enough to withstand the force generated when the
shunt engaged. Since a shunt is subjected to a shock load in
such a situation, it should be rigged with dynamic rope of 10-
millimeter or larger diameter, not webbing or static rope.


********** 2 June
unnamed pit, New Brunswick
rockfall
Melissa Hendrickson (18), her father Eric, brother Kyle,
and fellow caver Brian Altvater were checking out a number
of small pits in the New Brunswick highlands when they came
to a 30-foot deep sink with a deep pit at the bottom. They
rigged a 120-foot rope and Melissa descended.
After spending some time on the bottom she prepared to
climb back to the surface. As she was attaching her ascenders
to the rope, she heard a sudden loud noise. A large slab had
broken off the wall above, sending chunks of rock down the
pit. Melissa dove under an overhang for protection as they
rained down. A "truck-tire-sized" rock landed nearby, along
with many smaller rocks.
Melissa waited until the rocks stopped falling and she had
regained her composure, and then pulled on the rope while
remaining under the overhang to make sure all was clear and
that no more rocks were waiting to fall. She then cautiously
climbed and chimneyed up to the surface.

loose rocks in and around the pit prior to and during her
descent. Rockfall is unpredictable, however, and she cautions
that cavers must be alert to dangers beyond their control.


********** 23 June
Carpenter-Swago Cave, West Virginia
stranded in pit
Dan Peden, Carl Pierce, and two other cavers arrived at the
cave and rigged a 300-foot rope at the 145-foot entrance drop.
The drop is broken into three parts: an initial 78-foot drop, a
15-foot middle drop, and a final 50-foot drop to the cave's
lower level. All four cavers descended without incident.
Once in cave, the four began moving through horizontal
trunk passage punctuated with unremarkable breakdown
climbs. After traveling a short distance, however, one of the
cavers began experiencing extreme apprehension which, on a
small climb, progressed to a serious panic attack. The group
decided to terminate the trip.
At the entrance pit, Peden ascended first, assisted the
shaken caver with the first climb, and then continued to the
top. When attempts at encouraging the caver to climb the pit
on her own proved unsuccessful, they decided that she would
have to be hauled out. One of the other cavers climbed out to
assist, while Pierce stayed to help the stranded caver.
A second rope and components for a 3:1 Z-rig haul system
were retrieved from the vehicle and rigged to nearby trees.
The two topside cavers hauled the shaken caver up the pit as
Pierce ascended the primary rope beside her. Once on the
surface, she recovered quickly.
Daniel Peden, Incident report, 5 November 2002.
Comments: Peden observes: "Without the availability of a
simple haul system, outside assistance would have been
necessary. An otherwise simple event would have been
exaggerated into a rescue." It is a simple matter to set up a Z-
rig using two pulleys and your basic ascending gear. Many
cavers carry a pair of pulleys in their vertical kit for just such
an emergency. A second rope is helpful, but not required.

Earthquake 90 Cave, Tennessee
fatality, fell or jumped into pit
Jeffrey Wayne Young (43) told his family that he was
going on a week-long camping trip. When he did not return as
expected, his family reported him missing. Two weeks later, a
relative searching in the area around Young's home decided to
look in the cave and found Young's dog, a Rottweiler named
Spike, stranded in a hole just inside the entrance. Young had
been known to visit the cave in the past.
The relative called authorities, who entered the cave and
found Young's body at the bottom of a 70-foot pit about 500
feet into the cave. Cave rescuers were summoned to descend
the pit and recover Young's body.

deeds and other papers for light as he made his way to the pit.
He did not have caving equipment of any kind.


********** 4 July
unnamed Lancaster County cave, Pennsylvania
fatality, rockfall entrapment, collapse
Sharn Cleland (24) and four other cavers from the York
Grotto found a small entrance on the hillside. Feeling air flow
at the entrance, Cleland crawled in to check the lead. He was
about ten feet into the cave when a portion of the upper right
wall of the passage collapsed onto him. He was pinned, lying
on his back in a reclining position, by debris including a large

---------- Page 45 ----------
2001 Accident and Incident Reports
rock estimated to be about 18 inches thick and 30 inches in
diameter.
Cleland's companions could not move the rock, and
decided to call for help. A large-scale rescue response was
mobilized, and workers experienced in collapse rescue were
called in to assist. Efforts were complicated by the loose and
unstable nature of the cave passage, which was formed almost
entirely in loose breakdown.
Efforts to free Cleland continued through the night and
through the next day. By 2:00 p.m., rescuers had removed
most of the debris and were preparing to use hand chisels to
attack the large rock pinning Cleland when the passage
suddenly collapsed again. Rescuers were protected by sections
of plastic pipe being used as shoring, but Cleland was not
sheltered and was killed. Rescuers dug frantically for about 15
minutes to re-open the passage and reach Cleland, but were
forced to abandon the attempt when they realized that he had
been killed. They later used a backhoe to excavate the cave
entrance until Cleland's body could be recovered.

********** 15 July
Pettijohns Cave, Georgia
caver fall, climbing hand-over-hand
Cathy Stikes (17) was using a handline as she attempted to
climb up to an upper passage in the cave. The line was knotted
with loops to make it easier to grab. Stikes had inserted her
hand and wrist through one of the loops, and was about 15 feet
up when she slipped and fell. She lost her grip and fell about
six feet to a ledge, then fell an additional nine feet. She
sustained contusions to her legs and hips, but was otherwise
uninjured. After a rest, she was helped up the climb and out of
the cave by the other members of the group, one of whom was
an EMT.
Mike McDaniel, Incident report, 12 December 2001.
Comments: McDaniel notes that Stikes was tired and
frightened as she made the climb. She should have been
belayed. Handlines, even with loops to grab, often provide a
false sense of security in the wet and muddy cave
environment. Further, some cavers make matters worse by
using small diameter rope or accessory cord, which is even
more difficult to grip than regular caving or climbing rope.
Many cavers find that they are not able to pull themselves up
or hold themselves when a slip occurs. Add a little mud and
some fatigue from a day's caving and you have the potential
for a serious accident. If you know you will be doing climbs
with exposure greater than a body length, you should consider
carrying and using a belay.

caver fall
Tyler Bransetter (15) and his friend Brandon Lee (16) were
camping out near Great Onyx Crystal Cave when they decided
to take their flashlights and do some late-night caving. The
boys had been caving before, but had no proper caving
equipment or training. As Bransetter crawled across a ledge at
the top of a pit, he used a formation as a handhold. The
formation broke off, and he fell 25 feet to the bottom. He
struck his head as he fell and was briefly unconscious, but
sustained only cuts and bruises in the fall.
Lee saw his friend fall and tried to reach him, but could not
find a way down the pit. He dropped another flashlight down
to his friend and then went out to get help. Emergency
services personnel were notified at about midnight, and
dispatched rescuers to the cave. Bransetter was hauled up the
drop and brought out of the cave at about 9:00 a.m. the next
morning. He was taken to a hospital where he was treated and
released.

********** 28 July
Bowden Cave, West Virginia
flood entrapment
A group of two adult cavers and five Boy Scouts entered
the Main Entrance of Bowden Cave in the late morning,
planning to tour portions of the cave and exit via the Third
Entrance. They made their way through the Main Passage and
up the Water Course and explored the area beyond. They had
some difficulty finding the route to the Third Entrance and
decided to go back the way they had come.
When they reached the crawlway before the Water Course,
however, they found that it had only three or four inches of
airspace. Heavy rains on the surface had flooded the cave.
While the leaders had checked the Elkins area forecast earlier
in the week, they did not do SO on the day of the trip.
The cavers had driven from Maryland and were staying at
a local campground. They had left a note describing their
plans in their vehicle, but had not told anyone when they
expected to be out of the cave. The campground owner noticed
that the group did not return on Saturday night. When they
failed to return on Sunday, he became concerned. He knew
that they were caving in Randolph County and called
authorities there. They in turn called the Elkins fire
department. Suspecting that Bowden Cave was the most likely
destination for the group, firemen drove to the entrance where
they found the group's vehicle.

2001 Accident and Incident Reports
The first rescuers entered the cave on Sunday evening just
after nightfall. One team made its way through the Main
Passage and fought its way upstream through the Water
Course to the beginning of the crawl. The water was still too
high, and they were unable to get through the crawl.
Another team entered the Third Entrance and soon found
the stranded cavers. They had removed most of their wet
clothing and managed to stay relatively warm using space
blankets. Rescuers led them out the Third Entrance. Despite
their 39-hour stay in the cave, only one scout required
treatment for hypothermia at the hospital.
George Dasher, "Bowden Cave Rescue, West Virginia
Caver, v19n5, October 2001, p. 23.
Comments: One of the rules of caving, as well as Scouting,
is to "Be Prepared." The trip leaders should have let someone
know their plans. They should also have made sure they had a
map or guide to help them find their way to the Third
Entrance. Most importantly, they should have checked the
local weather forecast on the day of the trip. Given the chance
of rain and the nature of the cave passage, a different trip plan
or a different cave would have been in order. Fortunately, they
did have the space blankets.


********** 28 July
Pettijohns Cave, Georgia
exhaustion, hypothermia, poor judgment
While eating dinner Friday evening, members of a church
group on a two-week adventure-challenge trip decided that
they had not been sufficiently challenged during the week and
that a midnight caving trip would be in order. A group of 16
entered Pettijohns Cave around midnight. The cavers were
equipped with helmets and lights, but had little previous
caving experience.
As the group made its way into the cave, one member, a
17-year-old male, complained that he was cold. He was
dressed in cotton clothing and tennis shoes. The group visited
the Bridge Room, a trip which requires getting wet and muddy
coming and going. Along the way, another group member
became cold and was re-warmed with a makeshift heat tent.
As they made their way out, the 17-year old who had
complained earlier became cold and fatigued, and could not
continue. One of the two group members who knew the route
through the cave left to get help while the other remained with
the group.
Rescuers were called to the cave early Saturday morning
and sent in an initial response team carrying, medical supplies,
a fleece suit, food, and thermoses of hot tea. They found the
youth suffering from moderate hypothermia, but still able to
move and speak. His wet clothes were removed and he was
dressed in the fleece suit, then provided with hot tea and food.
Rescuers encouraged the young man to talk and move
around, and after a while he was able to start moving toward
the entrance. He was carefully escorted out of the cave, where
he was met by an ambulance and taken to a hospital for
examination. All members of the party were out of the cave by
10:00 a.m.
Diane Cousineau, Incident report, 28 July 2001.
Comments: One must question the wisdom of the group's
leaders in deciding to take them on a strenuous caving trip
after midnight, when they had been up all day and had been
engaged in outdoor activities all week. Starting a caving trip
already tired is not a good idea. Further, they ignored warning
signs as members of the group became cold, and continued
into the cave. Finally, they were not adequately dressed and
prepared for the cave conditions.


********** 1 September
Cass Cave, West Virginia
stranded in pit, sharing equipment
Four rock-climbers entered the cave and rigged the 160-
foot Belay Loft drop, using a dynamic climbing rope. They
were poorly equipped, with some members of the party
lacking helmets, and only a single set of Jumars for ascending.
After spending some time exploring, they returned to the base
of the pit and prepared to climb out.
The first person to climb reached the top of the pit without
incident. He placed the Jumars in a bag and attempted to lower
them to the others below, but the bag landed on a ledge. When
he pulled up the rope to try again, the Jumars apparently fell
out of the bag and were lost. With no other options, the man
left the cave to call for help.
A rescue group was mobilized from cavers attending the
Old Timers Reunion nearby. Entering the cave, the rescuers
re-rigged the pit with a static caving rope and hauled the
stranded climbers out of the pit.
George Dasher, "OTR 2001 Rescues, West Virginia Caver,
v19n5, October 2001, p. 2.
Comments: The dynamic rope was reported to have
suffered severe damage due to abrasion at the lip. It was
probably fortunate for the climbers that they were not able to
climb, since it might have been cut while in use. Sharing
vertical gear by passing it up or down the rope is a bad idea.


********** 1 September
Lost Creek Siphon, Montana
equipment problem
Jay Kennedy (41) was climbing out of the entrance pit
when the Croll ascender attached to the seat harness in his
Frog climbing system suddenly disengaged from the rope. The
ascender came off rope as he stood up and pulled the rope
downward through the ascender.
Kennedy had drilled a hole through the cam lock of his
"new style" Croll and threaded a loop of parachute cord
through the hole to make it easier to open the cam while
wearing wetsuit gloves. The cord caught on a projection on the
wall as he stood up, pulling the cam open. Kennedy was able
to reattach the ascender and complete the climb without
incident.
Jay Kennedy, Incident report, 16 October 2001.
Comments: Kennedy removed the cord after the incident.
It is generally not a good idea to make modifications like this
to carefully designed hardware.

were unable to find the route to the other entrance. Eventually,
they made their way back to the bottom of the pit. Some of the
cavers climbed back up the very muddy pit, but two members
of the group were unable to make the climb.
Two of the cavers left the cave and called for help. A
group of cavers from the Reunion came to the cave, located
the stranded cavers, and led them out the other entrance.

Comments: It was not clear from the reports exactly why

When making a through-trip, cavers should be prepared for
the possibility that they might have to climb back out.

John Browns Cave, West Virginia
lost, stranded, inadequate equipment
Philip Olmert (36) and his 8-year-old son Skylor entered
the cave on Sunday afternoon, equipped with helmets and
headlamps and wearing shorts and t-shirts. They expected to
return home that day. They made their way through about
2,000 feet of passage before deciding to head out as one of the
headlamps began to dim. On the way out they lost their way
and wound up in an upper passage. They did not have any
extra batteries. They were reported missing when they failed
to return home as expected.
Olmert's car was soon located near the entrance to the
cave, and a group of searchers composed of local cavers and a
ranger from nearby Harpers Ferry National Park entered the
cave at about 10:00 a.m. Monday morning. They soon found
the stranded cavers and led them from the cave. They were
chilled, but unharmed by the experience.

unspecified pit cave, Indiana
caver fall, stranded, no safety at pit lip
John Powell rigged his rope in the entrance of a new 40-
foot pit that he and his two companions planned to descend
and explore. Even though he was working at the edge of the
pit, Powell was not wearing a harness and was not clipped in
to the rope. As he leaned over to look down the drop, he
slipped on the mossy rock at the lip and fell in. He was able to
grab the rope as he fell, and gripped it as tightly as he could to
try to slow the fall. He succeeded, but incurred severe rope
burns to both hands as a result. It took about 90 minutes for
Powell to get back out of the pit with the help of his
companions.
John Powell, Incident report, 5 October 2001.
Comments: It is standard practice to be rigged in or on
belay whenever you are within a body-length of the edge of a
pit, or whenever a slip might result in a fall down the drop.
Powell was fortunate to have been able to grab the rope. A 40-
foot fall can easily be fatal.


********** 3 October
Pinnacles Cave, Nevada
exhaustion, stranded in pit, sharing equipment
Gareth Smith (38), Eric Smith (40), and two other men
entered Pinnacles Cave at about 12:30 p.m. None of the men
had much caving experience, and they lacked proper caving
equipment. None had helmets, and they had only two seat
harnesses and a small amount of vertical equipment between
them. They rigged the 120-foot entrance shaft with a 200-foot
rope, which they tied to a rock near the entrance using a series
of overhand knots.
One of the men decided to remain on the surface while the
others explored the cave. The first and most experienced caver
rappelled to a ledge about 70 feet down the pit and got off
rope. The others pulled up his harness and rappel equipment
and the second man used it to rappel to the ledge. The process
was repeated for the third man, and then used again to descend
the remaining 50 feet from the ledge to the bottom of the pit.
The men spent several hours exploring the passages below,
and returned to the entrance shaft at about 5:00 p.m. Using
three Gibbs ascenders rigged with accessory cord for foot
loops and a seat harness attachment, the first man climbed to
the 50-foot ledge, then lowered the ascending gear back down
for the next man. One of the men became very fatigued during
his climb.
Once all three cavers had reached the ledge, the strongest
caver ascended to the surface without difficulty. Once again,
he lowered the ascending gear to his companions waiting
below. This time, however, the second man was only able to
climb a few feet before becoming exhausted. The third caver
helped him climb back down to the ledge and get off rope.
They decided that they could not make it out without help.
The two men on the surface left and called authorities.
Rescuers responded, and rigged a haul system to bring the
men to the surface. They were mildly hypothermic, but
otherwise uninjured

caver fall
Jay Kennedy (41) and two other cavers were on a mapping
trip in Lost Creek Siphon. As Kennedy was standing near the
edge of Chockstone Drop, about 300 feet below the surface,
the floor suddenly fell away beneath him. As the rubble

collapsed, Kennedy's left leg sank in up to his groin.
Fortunately, Kennedy was clipped into a traverse line at the pit
with his cow's tail. He extricated himself from the hole and
warned the others of the danger.
Jay Kennedy, incident report, 6 October 2001.
Comments: The floor was composed of large cobbles and
decaying wood, trapped behind large bounders. The cave is a
wet alpine cave, and is subject to frequent flooding and the
resulting rearrangement of its contents. Kennedy notes that the
incident reinforces the need for care in the exploration of
dynamic alpine karst systems. Such caution is appropriate to
caves of all types, where loose rock and unstable flooring are
often encountered. Being clipped into the safety line probably
saved Kennedy from serious injury.

Skunk Cave, Iowa
stuck in crevice
Andy Wernimont (16), his father Phil, and two other
teenage boys entered Skunk Cave at about 10:00 a.m.
equipped only with flashlights. They had been exploring the
cave for about an hour when Andy slipped and became
wedged in a crevice about 250 feet from the entrance. He was
in a small, narrow passage, and his father could not reach him
well enough to pull him out. When their efforts to free Andy
failed, the others left the cave to call for help.
Rescuers from a local fire department arrived at the cave at
about 1:30 p.m. Cavers from the Iowa Grotto had also been
called, and soon began arriving at the cave. Throughout the
afternoon, the rescuers worked with little success to free Andy
from the crevice. They placed boards beneath him to prevent
him from slipping deeper, but were unable to move him
forward or backward through the passage.
After about 12 hours of struggle, rescuers were becoming
concerned that Andy was losing strength and could succumb
to hypothermia. John Ackerman, a caver who had been
recruited for the effort during the night, spent some time
reassuring Andy and considering the situation. Since the
efforts to that point had proved unsuccessful, he felt that a new
approach was needed.
Andy was covered with blankets, hot water bottles, and
other rescue paraphernalia, which obscured Ackerman's view
of the passage. This material was removed, and Ackerman
carefully studied the shape of the crevice and Andy's position.
He decided that if Andy could be lowered further into the
crevice, it would be possible to pull him forward, then up and
out of the passage.
Andy was fearful of going deeper into the crevice, but
Ackerman was able to convince him to give it a try. He held
Andy's wrist with one hand and grabbed the board with the
other. Another rescuer also grabbed the board from below. As
the men slid the board out from under him, Andy slipped
deeper and Ackerman pulled him forward. In a matter of
minutes, Andy was out of the crevice and able to move. He
was eager to be out, and was quickly escorted from the cave.

Gage Caverns, New York
stuck in crevice
Edward Galbavy, Kevin Shaw, Shioku Kudo, Adam
Dobson, and Brattingham entered the cave at about 11:00
a.m. and explored the dry side of the cave including part of the
Balls Down Crawl, returning to the Amphitheater at about
1:00 p.m. The group was exploring some small passages off
the Amphitheater when Kudo became wedged in a crevice,
lying on her side with her legs extended into a horizontal crack
at a 90-degree angle to her torso. Shaw and Galbavy tried to
help her, but were unsuccessful. Shaw then left the cave and
called for help.
Rescuers soon began arriving, and worked through the
afternoon and into the evening in unsuccessful attempts to free
Kudo. Little progress was made until Joe Armstrong and Ken
Fortuin entered the cave at about 7:20 p.m. and began drilling,
excavating, and removing rock from the passage.
Working together, Armstrong and Fortuin managed to
remove enough rocks to allow Kudo to slide out of the crevice
shortly after 9:00 p.m. She was wrapped in blankets and
allowed to recover for a while before being escorted from the
cave. She reached the surface at about 10:20 p.m.
Thom Engel, "Rescue at Gage Caverns," Northeastern Caver,
December 2001.
Comments: Engel notes that there was some confusion
during the early stages of the rescue operation regarding just
how long Kudo had been stuck in the cave, and feels that the
full-scale rescue should have been initiated sooner. He notes
that in the cold environment of Northeastern caves such as
Gage Caverns, an immobile caver can quickly develop
hypothermia. He recommends that cavers call for help in such
situations if they cannot free a trapped companion within
about 15 minutes. Fortunately, the situation ended well in spite
of any miscues in the early stages.

Bowden Cave, West Virginia
fatality, heart attack in cave
A group of 19 people from Hocking College in
Nelsonville, Ohio, entered Bowden Cave. They divided into
two groups, one of which went through the Main Passage and
started up the Water Course, As they made their way
upstream, one member of the party, a 23-year-old male who
reportedly weighted about 250 pounds, asked to stop and rest.
He did not complain of any pain.
The group continued, stopping several times along the
passage. At about 3:15 p.m., the group was stopped about
halfway up the Water Course when the man suddenly lost
consciousness and fell between two instructors. Members of
the group administered CPR for about 30 minutes, but the man
could not be revived.
Members of the group left the cave to summon help. The

unspecified cave, Kentucky
rockfall entrapment
Shelly Wolf and two other cavers were working on a
digging lead located in a small room at the end of a short
crawl off the bottom of a 13-foot deep hole. Wolf and another
caver were filling buckets with rocks and mud from the dig SO
that the third caver could pull the debris from the hole. After
about three hours, the group decided to take a break, and Wolf
started back out of the room.
As she started into the crawl, she noticed what appeared to
be a loose rock in the ceiling. Not wanting it to fall on her, she
reached up to pull it down and put it aside. The rock turned
out to be much larger than Wolf expected, and fell onto her
legs, pinning them in the crawl. She called out to her
companion, who came quickly and tried to help her move the
rock. Before they could do so, however more mud and rock
from the wall collapsed onto Wolf, burying her legs and
leaving only her arms free.
Realizing that they needed tools and assistance, the other
cavers went to get help. Rescuers responded, and spent 4 to 5
hours digging until Wolf could be pulled out of the crawl. She
was mildly hypothermic, but was able to walk out of the cave
with a little assistance.

an additional ascender and continued his climb, stopping
frequently to clear ice from the ascender cams. Abrasive
action by the rope and the ice wore a hole in the 4-millimeter

he could make it out if they moved slowly, and the group
started for the entrance, taking frequent rests as they went. As
they were making their way up a breakdown slope, Miller told
the others he was blacking out, slid about 15-20 feet down the
slope, and struck his head at the bottom. Hughes, who is also a
physician, started CPR and sent the other caver to get help.
Hughes administered CPR by herself for about 30 minutes,
and then continued for more than an hour after rescuers began

Sistema Purificacion, Tamaulipas, Mexico
caver fall, broken leg
Terri Treacy, Pat Shaw, and Laura Rosales were surveying
in the Chimichanga Tube, about 900 meters from Camp I.
They began with a side passage that was reached by a short
climb. Treacy was about halfway up the climb when a hand-
hold that she was using broke off. She fell, striking the floor of
the main passage and landing in a small tube in the floor.
Treacy knew immediately that she had seriously injured
her ankle. She climbed out of the tube and removed her boot
to assess the damage. They had traveled to the survey site in
the company of a larger group of cavers, SO Shaw and Rosales
went to get help. They were unable to locate the others in the
confusing maze of tubes and passages, and soon returned.
Treacy's ankle was swollen and painful, but she felt that
she could make it back to camp with a little help. They
fashioned a splint using a vinyl survey book bag padded with a
shirt and tied with bandannas, then taped with adhesive tape
from their first aid kit.
Treacy took some aspirin to help with the pain and
swelling, and started her long crawl to camp. A 14-meter drop
along the way presented an obstacle, but Shaw and Rosales
each had a length of tubular webbing in their packs. With
Rosales belaying her and Shaw spotting from below, Treacy
climbed down the first 10 meters of the drop. Rosales then
rigged the webbing to allow her to rappel the remaining few
meters.

After a rest and some more aspirin for Treacy, they
continued. Unfortunately, they missed a turn and spent some
time off-route before realizing their mistake. As they
approached the next obstacle, another climb-down at Jump
Rock, they encountered the other cavers from their original
party. With the extra help, Treacy made it down the climb and
finally reached Camp I after more than eight hours of crawling

Treacy took some stronger pain medication available at the
Camp and spent the night resting. The next morning, she
started out of the cave accompanied by several of the other
cavers. She felt weak and nauseous at first, possibly due to the

1999 Cave Diving Incidents


********** 10 February 1999
Wakulla Springs, Florida
lost consciousness, incorrect gas mixture
Jason Richards, Mark Long, Jason Moseley, and Annette
Long, divers working with the National Geographic film crew
for the expedition, entered the spring in the late afternoon for a
planned 10-minute dive to set up lights at -100 feet. Along
with their primary gas bottles, the divers carried bottles of
pure oxygen which they intended to place on a ledge at -20
feet for use during decompression.
Richards carried back-mounted double tanks filled with a
gas mixture intended for use at his working depth. Although
the gas mixture was breathable at the surface, he chose to
breathe from the oxygen bottle initially, intending to switch to
the doubles when he dropped the oxygen off at -20 feet. He
apparently forgot to make the switch, and breathed oxygen to
a depth of at least 50 feet.
About eight minutes into the dive, Richards lost
consciousness, became inverted, and descended to the bottom.
Mark Long saw Richards in trouble, and alerted the other two
divers. They were able to get Richards to the surface within
one minute of the incident. Other expedition personnel were
on the surface nearby, and helped pull Richards from the
water. He suffered from spasms and vomiting, but appeared to
be recovering.
Richards was taken to the hospital where he was placed in
a hyperbaric chamber as a precautionary measure, and then
given a CT scan and chest X-ray to check for embolism or
aspiration. He was hospitalized overnight for observation, and
released the next day.

meter rappel from the entrance went without incident, and her
companions helped her through the boulder-filled arroyo to
reach a waiting vehicle.
Treacy was then driven to a hospital in Brownsville,
Texas, where she learned that she had broken her tibia and
fibula just above the ankle, and the surgery would be required.
She opted for a temporary splint and a trip home to Illinois.
She arrived on Christmas Eve, and had surgery on her leg
three days later.
Terri Treacy, "The Long Crawl," AMCS Activities
Newsletter 25, May 2002, pp. 101-103.
Comments: Treacy demonstrated a great deal of strength
and fortitude in what was undoubtedly a grueling ordeal.
Comments: Pure oxygen is toxic to the central nervous
system at depth. Divers use it in shallow water at the final
decompression stage to shorten decompression time.
Following the incident, the diving protocols were reviewed,
and all divers were required to lower their oxygen bottles to
the -20 feet decompression location using a tether.


********** 15 February 1999
Wakulla Springs, Florida
fatality, lost consciousness, cause unknown
According to the expedition report, diver Henry Kendall
(72) bypassed both written and electronic safety checklists for
his closed circuit rebreather diving equipment and entered the
water without the oxygen supply connected to the rebreather.
The report states that Kendall ignored the rebreather system's
audible and visual warning indicators, and had entered the
water without his diving partner. It further states that Kendall
lost consciousness in less than two meters of water and
drowned. The expedition report also states that the coroner's
report indicated that Kendall had some physiological problems
before the dive which were believed to have led to his
disregard of the safety protocols.
A press release issued by the expedition on 18 February
1999, however, states that information received by the
expedition from the Medical Examiner's office indicated that
Kendall had died from natural causes, and that his death had
no relationship to either his pre-dive procedures or his
equipment.

Diepolder Spring, Florida
fatality, incorrect gas mixture, lost consciousness
Guido Gaudenzi (29) and fellow divers Simone Roncoli
and Sandra Derksen entered the cave and descended 190 feet
along a passage leading to a large room. They were diving on
mixed gases, with oxygen bottles for the final decompression
stage on their return. Rather than leaving his oxygen bottle at
the -20 feet decompression location, Gaudenzi carried his with
him.
When they finished exploring the chamber, they began
their ascent to the surface. At the -120 feet decompression
stop, Gaudenzi apparently switched mouthpieces and breathed
from the oxygen bottle. He immediately went into convulsions
and lost consciousness, dropping his mouthpiece. Derksen and
Roncoli tried to save him, but were unsuccessful.
Graham Brink, "Mistake costs diver his life," St. Petersburg
Times, 28 April 1999.
Comments: As noted above for the 10 February Wakulla
Springs incident, pure oxygen is toxic at depths greater than
66 feet. Many divers secure their oxygen tanks at the -20 foot
level to avoid mistakes. Gaudenzi was an experienced diver,
and reportedly had been a cave diver for four years.


********** 24 June 1999
Thunderhole, Florida
lost, stranded
A diver was rescued after being stranded in a small room
in the cave for almost six hours. She was an experienced and
certified cave diver, but had not been to Thunderhole before.
The permanent dive line started about 12 feet below the
surface. She entered the water opposite the dive line, and
wound up in a small room that is difficult to get out of wearing
full diving equipment. Visibility was about 1-foot from the
surface down to a depth of about 30 feet due to an algae
bloom, and she did not realize that she was entering the cave
at the wrong spot until she was trapped.
Her dive partner had gone first, taking the correct route,
and was waiting for her at a decompression stop at -30 feet.
When she did not arrive, he surfaced to check on her. Finding
that she was not at the surface, he thought she might have
passed him in the poor visibility, SO he went back down and
searched along the main dive line in the cave. When he did not
find her, he surfaced and called for help.
The trapped diver attempted a line search, but her diving
reel jammed. She lost her knife trying to free the reel. She then
settled on the ceiling and created an air pocket at -8 feet. She
breathed from her tanks, and then breathed her exhaled air in
the pocket. She could hear vehicles on the surface, and banged
on the ceiling to attract attention. A recovery diver entered the
water and heard the banging. He was able to locate her in
about ten minutes and bring her to the surface.

route out of the cave. They were found just beyond a
constriction in the passage called the Half Hitch, about 850
feet into the cave. When found by recovery divers, their main
guideline was reportedly broken, and one of the divers was
tangled in the line. They had deployed safety reels of line,
apparently searching for the main line or the way out.
Apparently they were unable to recover the main line or find
the route, and ran out of air.

fatality, siltation, exceeded training
Michael Hickey (27) and his dive partner entered Little
River Spring equipped with double tanks and dive propulsion
vehicles. They dropped oxygen bottles for decompression in
the cavern zone and then proceeded deeper into the cave,
using their vehicles to travel approximately 2,250 feet back
into the cave system. At that point, Hickey reportedly dropped
his scooter and silted out the passage. The two divers became
separated. Hickey's partner found his way out, but Hickey did
not. Rescue attempts were unsuccessful due to the heavy silt
conditions.
Jeffrey Bozanic, "Cave Diving Fatalities in 2000,

Comments: Bozanic reports that both divers were diving
beyond their level of training and certification. They held the
Intro-Cave Diving certification, which does not include the
use of double tanks and dive propulsion vehicles. He also
notes that it had been a year since either had been in Little
River, and neither had been diving at all for six months.

Cenote Dos Ojos, Mexico
decompression sickness
While exploring a newly discovered chamber, Jill and Paul
Heinerth were forced to end their dive on March 10 at a depth
of 95 meters when Jill had trouble with her left sinus. They
dove again on following day, and were able to continue their
exploration, turning the dive after a maximum depth of 107
meters.
During their ascent, they divers were decompressing at a
depth of about 18 meters when Jill Heinerth noticed that the
garments under her dry suit had started to pinch and feel
uncomfortably snug. Adjustments to the suit did not relieve
the discomfort. At six meters depth, the divers entered a dry
tank for their two-hour final decompression stage. Getting her
55-pound rebreather system into the tank and adjusting the
tight suit required some exertion.
After reaching the surface, Heinerth spent some time
resting before climbing the ladder out of the cenote. As she
climbed, she felt "extremely fatigued" and realized that she
was suffering from decompression sickness. She spent the
evening resting and breathing from a tank containing a 70%
oxygen mixture.
The next morning, she still felt the effects and decided to
go back into the water and repeat the final stages of
decompression. Using her rebreather, she spent about two
hours at a depth of 13 meters. By noon she was feeling much
better. The following day she hiked out from camp and went
to a hyperbaric facility at Playa del Carmen, where she
underwent three treatments.
Jill Heinerth, "An Incident at The Pit," AMCS Newsletter 24,
June 2001, p. 86.
Comments: Heinerth felt that the incident was caused by a
combination of factors: diving deep on two consecutive days;
physical exertion before, during, and after the dive; and the
tightness from the suit. She writes that she felt "swept up in
the expedition fever" and may have been "doing too much, too
quickly." Heinerth further notes that she was initially hesitant
to admit that she had made a mistake, feeling that she would
be criticized, but feels that it is important for divers to share
their experiences SO that others can learn from them.

Stephen John Turner (42) drowned while on a solo dive in
Little River Spring. He had not told anyone that he would be

Comments: Bozanic notes that Turner had no cave or
cavern diving training or certification. He apparently failed to
follow the "Rule of Thirds" for air management, and carried
only two light sources, neither of which was adequate for use
as a primary cave diving light. He passed by an explicit
warning sign at the base of the cavern zone, but apparently
disregarded its advice.

Poza de Juan Claro, Cuba
four fatalities, inadequate equipment, no line
Jorge Luis (36), Lin Enrique (31), Israel Garcia (32), and
Roberto Lagart (33) entered Poza de Juan Claro, a reversing
blue hole cave in Cuba. All were certified open water divers,
but none had cave diving training or certification. All were
using single 80-cubic-foot cylinders. One diver carried two
lights, and the others each had one. The cave has a permanent
guide line that begins well inside the entrance. The divers did
not lay their own line from the entrance to that line. One diver
had a dive computer, which indicated a maximum depth of 35
feet. The only place in the cave where that depth can be
reached is a small, restricted, silty side tunnel. All four divers
were found with their tanks empty.
Jeffrey Bozanic, "Cave Diving Fatalities in 2000,"
Underwater Speleology, v28n2, 2001, p. 6.
Comments: Bozanic observes that the divers violated
several basic safety rules: they failed to run a continuous guide
line from the surface; they failed to carry three lights each; and
they apparently failed to reserve two-thirds of their air for

cranial fracture, which may have occurred during the final
moments of the dive after he had run out of air.


********** 13 July 2000
Cenote Sabak Ha, Mexico
fatality, apparent heart attack
Rafael Mendiburu (55), an experienced and certified cave
diver, died of an apparent heart attack while diving in Cenote
Sabak Ha. He was exploring the cave with another diver,
planning to spend 15 minutes at a depth of -180 feet using
open circuit trimix gas. The pair left oxygen cylinders at -20
feet for decompression, descended to -150 feet on air, then
switched to the mixed gas cylinders before descending to their
planned depth.
After five minutes at -180 feet, Mendiburu signaled to his
partner that he wanted to turn the dive. The divers ascended to
-150 feet and switched back to air, then continued toward the
surface. At -140 feet, Mendiburu was having difficulty
breathing from his regulator. He switched regulators, but
continued to have difficulty. His partner tested the regulator,
which seemed to be operating properly. The partner swam
rapidly to a decompression stop at -90 feet, while Mendiburu
held onto his harness. During this time Mendiburu was
clutching at his chest with his other hand.
At -75 feet, Mendiburu released his grip and floated away
from his partner. He was located a few minutes later on the
ceiling at -40 feet, unresponsive and with his regulator out of
his mouth. His partner freed him from the ledge and released
him to float to the surface. Ascending to -20 feet, he did two
minutes decompression before going to the surface to drag
Mendiburu to shore. He called for the surface support team to
attend to Mendiburu, who was unresponsive and not
breathing, and descended to complete his decompression.
Mendiburu could not be resuscitated.

Comments: An autopsy found that Mendiburu had suffered
a major heart attack, as well as a cerebral air embolism.
Bozanic notes that the event appears to have been caused by a
heart attack while at depth. No cave diving rules were broken.
Mendiburu was the President of one of Mexico's leading cave
diving organizations, Exploradores Subaquaticos.


********** 17 September 2000
unnamed well in Goss Canyon, California
fatality, breathed bad air in gas pocket
Paul Hayden (38) and his brother entered the cavern at
about 11:00 a.m. through an abandoned well shaft, crawling
about 50 feet through the tunnel and then 30 feet down a slope
to reach a water-filled room. Hayden anchored a rope at the
edge of the water for use as a guideline, and prepared to begin
his dive. He told his brother that he had two hours of air, and
to get help if he did not return within that time. When he did
not respond to tugs on the rope, his brother went for help,
calling authorities at about 1:20 p.m.
Hayden's body was recovered from a 4-foot diameter
tunnel immediately below a gas pocket. A videotape recovered
from his camera indicated that Hayden had poked his head
into the gas pocket and removed his regulator from his mouth.
The camera then recorded a fall to the bottom and no further
movement. Hayden's body was recovered with 2,500 psi in his
air cylinder. Hayden was an experienced open-water diver and
a member of an elite Air Force rescue team, but had no cave
diving training or certification.

3. "Air Force Diver Drowns in Cave," Fire Rescue
Magazine, November 2000, p. 53.
Comments: Bozanic notes that while Hayden violated
several classic rules of cave diving safety (exceeding his
training and certification, and lacking a proper guideline and
cave diving lights), the videotape indicates that the fatality
was caused by breathing gas from an "air" pocket that was
either too low in oxygen or contained some other gas in a level
sufficient to cause immediate loss of consciousness. He
observes that the incident underscores the potential hazards of
breathing from air pockets in caves.


********** 2 November 2000
Ceita Core, Brazil
fatality, deep diving on air
Gustavo Sallum (21) was lost when he failed to return
from a solo dive to -60 meters on air. Two other divers were
also in the cave exploring a side tunnel, and Sallum was
expected to rejoin them at the exit following his dive. When
he did not return, the other divers attempted to locate him, but
were forced to call their dive due to depth and air supply
constraints.
Sallum was later recovered from a depth of 105 meters.
When found, he had 1,600 psi of air in his tanks and his
equipment was all operational. His regulator was out of his
mouth, his fists were clenched, and the permanent dive line
was tangled around his neck. He had apparently been alert and
functioning at -80 meters, because he had negotiated a
restriction in the passage at that depth in order to continue.
Sallum was certified as an NSS-CDS Full Cave Diver.

Core," www.scubadu.com.br/acidenteembonito.htm
undated.
Comments: Bozanic notes that the cause of most cave
fatalities of experienced cave divers has been diving to excess
depth on air. He observes that the clenched fists, air remaining
in the cylinders, and regulator out of the mouth all indicate
either a convulsion or unconsciousness at depth, possibly due
to oxygen toxicity, deep water blackout, or other factors.

********** 18 February 2001
Royal Springs, Florida
two fatalities, no guideline, out of air
Mark Granger (19) and William Ridenour (34) entered
Royal Springs at about 4:30 p.m. Both held certifications for
open water diving, but neither had any training or certification
for cave or cavern diving. Granger had just received his open
water diving certification that morning. The men came to the
spring in the company of their diving instructor and another
diver, planning to spend some time exploring the spring pool
while the instructor retrieved a concrete anchor from the pool.
The instructor and his partner made one dive and retrieved
the anchor. Each team then took a flashlight and prepared to
dive, intending to explore the spring pool. As they descended,
the instructor's partner had trouble equalizing, SO the
instructor stayed with him. By the time they got down,
Ridenour and Granger had entered the cave, and visibility in
the cavern zone was zero.
The instructor found the entrance to the cave and had his
partner stay there while he swam a short distance inside to try
to find the other divers. When he was unsuccessful, he and his
partner surfaced, and the partner was sent to call for help. The
instructor returned to the cave entrance where he waited,
flashing his light and banging rocks in the hope that Ridenour
and Granger would hear or see the signals and make their way
out. He kept signaling for about 45 minutes until rescue divers
arrived to relieve him.
The rescue diver tied off a line and searched the cavern
zone (still in zero visibility) and about 40 feet into the cave.
He then tied off his reel and left it for the two missing divers
to exit on if they should find it. Additional cave divers entered
the water at about 6:30 p.m. and searched the first 300 feet of
passage in the cave, but did not find the missing pair. Due to
the poor visibility, elapsed time, and concerns for the safety of
the rescue divers, rescue efforts were suspended until the next
day.
When the search was resumed the next morning, the
recovery divers found indications that Ridenour and Granger
had entered a small side tunnel about 350 feet into the cave,
accessible only with side-mount gear. When the tunnel was
searched, Granger's body was found about 500 feet into the
cave, with Ridenour about 50 feet beyond, at the end of the
small tunnel. Their air cylinders were empty. Recovery divers
brought both men to the surface.

They had only one light between them.


********** 26 February 2001
Cenote Escondido (Mayan Blue), Mexico
fatality, left guideline, out of air
Ron Fraga (46) drowned after running out of air when he
apparently was unable to find his way out of the cave during a
solo dive. He had completed an earlier dive of the A-Tunnel
and the parallel Death Arrow Passage with his wife Nancy,
and decided to make a second dive solo with a fresh set of
tanks. His stated intention was to dive the A-Tunnel until he
reached his 2/3 air mark and then exit. Fraga started his dive at
2:18 p.m. When he had not returned two hours later, his wife
became concerned and went for help.
Rescue divers were called, and arrived at the cave at about
5:30 p.m. After agreeing on a plan of action, they entered the
cave, following Fraga's primary line along the A-Tunnel.
They encountered an abnormal amount of cloudy water, which
was attributable to two earlier dives in the A-Tunnel that day.
About 1,100 feet into the cave and 21 minutes into the
dive, they spotted Fraga's body. He was about 70 feet from the
main Gold Line in an area where several offshoot lines
separate from the main line. His double tanks were empty. He
was lying on top of one of the offshoot lines, facing toward the
Gold Line. The water was clear. There was no temporary jump
line connecting to the main line.
The divers followed the offshoot line 250 feet down the
passage to a room where it looped back to join the A-Tunnel.
There was also no temporary jump line at that location.

disoriented and could not find his way out. He had failed to
maintain a continuous guideline to the surface, and was not
fully equipped for a solo dive. Fraga was a certified cave
diver, having completed his certification four years earlier,
and had logged 125 cave dives.


********** 26 February 2001
Clarksville Cave, New York
fatality, stuck, inexperience, out of air
Robert Svensson (23), Jonathan Allison (23), Joseph Baj
(24), and Michael Chu (22) entered via the Ward Entrance at
about 7:00 p.m. planning to clear rocks and debris from the
entrance to the sump passage in the Lake Room leading to
Pauley's Avenue. All were experienced in dry caving, but
none had any training or certification in cave diving. Allison
and Baj had been certified in open water diving less than a
year earlier, and Svensson had not yet completed his open-
water certification. Chu was not a diver. Svensson had
reportedly completed two sump dives at another location.
The group carried their diving equipment through about
1,000 feet of dry passage to the Lake Room, where a 10-foot
deep pool hides the 3-foot wide, 16-inch high opening to
Pauley's Avenue. Svensson, Allison, and Baj each used knife
straps and a waist belt to fashion a thigh attachment system for
a pony air bottle, regulator, octopus, and console. Other than
masks, wetsuits and a single 4-AA flashlight strapped to the
forearm, no other diving equipment was used.
The three divers took turns in the pool clearing debris from
the passage opening. There is little flow in the sump, and the
water was soon full of suspended silt, with zero visibility.
Allison went down several times, and Svensson and Baj each
made two trips into the pool. Allison had 400 psi showing on
his tank (1/7 full) and Baj had 1700 psi (3/5 full) on his.
Svensson had 1200 psi (1/3 full) remaining, and decided to
make one more dive.
Svensson was down for several minutes when his bubbles
stopped coming to the surface. They others were not alarmed
at first, figuring that he had gone into the passage and that the
bubbles were being captured there. When several more
minutes passed with no sign of activity, they became
concerned. Allison went into the water and searched for
Svensson, feeling around until his tank was empty and he had
to surface. Baj then entered the pool and also searched for
several minutes, but could not find Svensson.
Chu left the cave to call for help, while Allison took Baj's
tank and continued to search. This time he was able to find
Svensson's feet in the entrance to the passage. He was able to
move Svensson about a foot, but could not get him out. After
two more attempts to get Svensson out, Allison's air supply
was again exhausted. He made several more free dives, trying
to pull Svensson out of the passage, before determining that
the situation was hopeless.
Fire department and cave rescue personnel soon arrived,
and called in trained cave divers to assist. Svensson was
jammed in the tight passage, and his body was not recovered
until three days later, after pumps were used to lower the pool
and expose the entrance of the passage. Rescuers were then
able to free his body and bring him out of the cave.
It was not clear how Svensson became trapped, but from
the position of his body it appeared to rescuers that he became
stuck when he tried to back out of the tight passage. This
could have been due to rocks or obstructions shifting in the
passage, or it could be that he was unable to maneuver his
body around the bends and turns or past the overhang at the
entrance to the passage. Unfortunately, he did not have enough
air to allow him much time to deal with the situation.

Comments: Martuscello notes that "virtually every cave
diving rule was broken on this dive." The divers were
exceeding their training and certification. They did not run a
continuous guideline from the surface. Svensson had only one
light source, and did not follow the standard cave diving rule
of thirds for air management. Martuscello further notes that
the rule of thirds is not considered to be conservative enough
for Northeastern sump diving, where a rule of sixths is often
used, and that Svensson's air level indicated that it was time to
exit the water, not begin a dive.
The incident report notes that the choice of equipment was
not entirely unusual for the circumstances, explaining that the
very restrictive, cold, and zero-visibility passages require one
to use very specialized methods to safely dive such sumps.
The goal is to get through the water-filled portion and into dry
passage safely, and weights, buoyancy compensators, fins, etc.
are sometimes considered luxuries. Svensson did not have the
necessary training to safely use the techniques and equipment
he was using or to dive safely in the environment where he
died.

was about 300 to 400 feet into the cave when the divers turned
out their lights to see how dark it would become. When they
turned the lights back on, Burns' dive partner saw a light
ahead of him and thought it was Burns. When the group
reached the entrance, the realized Burns was missing and re-
entered the cave to search for him. When they were
unsuccessful, they left the cave to call for help. They
encountered a group of divers from the Woodville Karst Plain
Project at the entrance. The WKPP divers made two attempts
to locate Burns. His body was found the next morning, about

Jackson Blue Spring, Florida
fatality, cause unknown
Jonathan Gol (46) had completed a dive in the cavern zone
and was decompressing at -20 feet when he lost
consciousness. He was quickly pulled from the water, but
could not be revived. He had used compressed air during the
active portion of his dive, and switched to another bottle for
decompression. Later examination of the decompression bottle
suggested that it might have been filled with 100% helium
rather than oxygen. The valve had come loose, however, and
the bottle was empty and had apparently become contaminated
with air before it was tested, SO no definitive answer could be
determined. There was some concern that Gol might have had
a problem related to a serious illness he had suffered several
weeks earlier. An autopsy reportedly found no indication of
physical problems that might explain the incident.

southeastern Ohio by deputies checking on a report of an
unfamiliar car. Albright had been camping in the cave
awaiting the impact of a large meteor he expected to strike the
Earth at 4:00 a.m. on August 11.
When deputies checked Albright's car and found 16 guns
and ammunition, they decided to search the surrounding
woods. They found him in the cave, where he had been since
at least August 8. He had been drinking water that dripped
from the ceiling and was using a pool to keep his food cold.
According to Noble County Sheriff Landon Smith, "He
very sincerely thought that there was a meteor that was going
to hit the Atlantic Ocean and cause a tidal wave 200 feet high.
It was going to go up the coast, take Florida for sure and there
would be water all over Georgia." Albright was charged with
disorderly conduct and released after posting bond. Deputies
escorted him to the interstate and told him to head home.

unspecified cave, Alabama
kidnapping victim left in cave
A woman who was kidnapped, assaulted, and left
unconscious in a cave in Blount County was found when she
awakened and called 911 on her cell phone. Using information
from their newly activated Enhanced 911 system, dispatchers
were able to determine the location of the cell tower which
handled the call, and notified the Blount County Fire
Department to search caves in the area nearby. The signal
strength of the call indicated that the woman was not far from
the tower, and rescuers, who were familiar with the area,
located the woman about 27 minutes after her call was
received. She was taken to a hospital for treatment.

Emisine Cave, Hawaii
caver fall, cut by sharp rock
Cindy Heazlit (43) was carrying a 45-pound backpack
while hiking to the entrance of Emisine with a group of cavers
who planned to camp in the cave. It had been raining heavily

for several days before the trip, and the footing was very
slippery as she made her way slowly across a lava field.
As she crossed over a lava dome, she slipped and slid
down the side. She put out her hand to stop the fall and
grabbed a piece of broken lava, which sliced deeply into the
palm and thumb of her right hand. She was almost to the cave,
SO she waited until she could get inside and out of the rain to
treat the wound.
Heazlit irrigated the wound with bottled water, applied
antibiotic ointment from the first aid kit, closed the laceration
with steri-strips and a Tegaderm patch, and wrapped her hand
with gauze topped off with a layer of duct tape. She was able
to continue the three-day expedition, but later developed a
persistent infection in her hand which required a course of
antibiotics.
Cindy Heazlit, Incident report, 26 February 2001.
Comments: Heazlit recommends wearing heavy gloves
when hiking in wet lava, and notes that the fact that the group
had well-stocked first aid kits allowed her to continue with the
expedition.

The National Cave Rescue Commission
The National Cave Rescue Commission (NCRC) is a
volunteer group developed to train cave rescue personnel
throughout the United States. It is part of the NSS, located
within the Department of the Administrative Vice-President.
The NCRC does not perform cave rescues. It organizes,
develops, and provides training in cave rescue techniques,
maintains lists of cave rescue trained persons, and can help
locate rescue resources in times of need. Most NCRC-trained
cavers do participate in rescues, but not as part of the NCRC.
They work as members of their local rescue squads, civil
defense units, or cave rescue groups.
The NCRC also works to:
Maintain good working relationships with other rescue-
oriented individuals, organizations, government agencies,
and sources of specialized equipment and services (e.g.,
the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center and Center for
Mine Safety and Health Administration).
Maintain current files of possibly useful equipment (e.g.
underground communications equipment, cave-oriented
medical kits) or services which can be obtained through
the above sources.
Acquire and maintain a limited supply of certain
equipment such as special rescue litters and vertical
rescue gear in key locations throughout the country.
Increase the number and proficiency of cave rescuers
across the U.S., by sponsoring training sessions and
seminars, and by encouraging other caving, rescue, or
EMS organizations to sponsor such educational programs.
Encourage international cooperation by developing
contacts with cave rescuers and rescue agencies in other
countries, by preplanning with these groups where US
involvement is anticipated, and by inviting participation
of cave rescuers from other countries in NCRC seminars.
Organization
The NCRC is led by a Board of Regional Coordinators.
The Board includes a National Coordinator, Training
Coordinator, Medical Coordinator, and Diving Coordinator
(each of whom coordinates resources and activities at a
national level), and Regional Coordinators for each of ten
regions in the United States and its territories. Board members

are nominated by cavers and cave rescue personnel, and
appointed by the NSS Board of Governors. The NCRC
depends on many volunteers without official positions whose
special knowledge, talents, or contacts make the network more
effective.
Training
The NCRC sponsors a week-long Cave Rescue Operations
and Management Seminar each year that is held in various
locations around the US. The seminar serves as a "boot camp"
of cave rescue and involves three levels of training. Cave
rescue is constantly evolving, and the most up-to-date
techniques are presented each year. In addition to the annual
national week-long seminar, the NCRC regions sponsor
regional week-long seminars, regional modular seminars
(taught over a series of weekends), courses in small-group and
self-rescue techniques, and weekend cave rescue orientation
courses.
NCRC seminars consist of extensive classroom and field
work designed to maximize the learning experience. The cave
rescue programs provide studies in underground
environments, vertical rescue, mechanical advantage systems,
extrication techniques, basic medical principles,
communications, and management of cave rescue operations.
Emphasis is placed on practical skills and techniques, with
realistic exercises in a variety of cave environments.
The seminars provide basic and advanced material for
students who typically include cavers, emergency services
personnel, and emergency managers. During the eight days of
a seminar, students receive about 100 hours of instruction, and
are "on the move" from early morning well into the evening.
The NCRC uses and teaches the Incident Command System
(ICS) used by fire departments, rescue squads, and other
emergency agencies and services.
Course Listings and Contact Information
Information on NCRC operation, activities, and training,
including contact information for NCRC Coordinators, is
published each year in the NSS Members Manual, and is also
available on the NCRC web site at www.caves.org/io/ncrc.

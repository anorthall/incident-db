A Tribute to American Caving Accidents
During four-and-a-half decades of caving, I have found it enjoyable, educational, and meaningful to study
each edition of American Caving Accidents (ACA). Upon reflection, it seems that ACA never ceases to provide
laughter, learning, tributes, and remembrances.
Laughter because of those little incidents that have a happy ending, and that are embarrassingly familiar
to most cavers that have gone underground for more than a time or two. An accidental slide down a muddy
slope into a chilly pool of water. Then hopping back up, straightening your eyeglasses, and enduring the
playful teasing of your teammates. A cup-over-teakettle tumble, planting you on your head, but surprisingly
finding things none the worse for the wear. Starting a perfect rappel, and then having your partner point out
that she is still holding your helmet in her hand. Frogging back out to near the top of a surface pit, and then
realizing that you have left the cars keys conscientiously hidden under a rock near the bottom of the deepest
drop. Lots of caving. Lots of experiences. Lots of smiles.
Learning by reading about the misfortune of others, and then applying those lessons to your future cave
explorations. Being reminded that some incidents are catalyzed by a singular catastrophic calamity, while
others seem to snowball from a series of little hiccups into something that is eventually out of control. As
such, ACA serves as a tutor and as a mentor. Proving by written example the old adage, "Except by the grace
of the good Lord, there go I." Raw experience certainly is a ruthless teacher. But, fortunately, ACA is a more
benevolent one.
Tributes to cavers who survived scary events, and to the rescue personnel that saved them. Consider,
for instance, an underground entrapment caused by unexpected flash flooding. It takes a lot of strength of
character to hustle above the high-water mark, try to stay warm, marshal your resources, keep your spirits
up, and hang in there for however long it takes for the water to go back down. It's a tough situation, testing
the courage of the caver. Meanwhile, the rescuers (often including your cave-club friends) work relentlessly,
fret, worry, rely on their training, fight through exhaustion, and hope for the best. ACA is replete with inspir-
ing stories of cavers, and of rescue teams, who have endured much to bring everyone back home safe and
sound.
Remembrances of people, of cavers, of friends, and of times that changed everything forever. Honoring
those that are gone. Encouraging those that are left behind. Powerful stories, these. Moving words shared
with the world through the mechanism of ACA. On a splendid day, two exceptional young men and their
team journeyed to one of the greatest pits in the South. An open-air wonder, a speleo-classic, a frequently
visited spectacular, a drop for the ages. Two young men, full of hope and of promise. Excellent students from
one of the top technological universities in America. Positioned at the bottom of a 23-story-deep pit, and en-
sconced in the recommended safe place-under a sheltering overhang, and thus well protected from small
stones accidentally kicked in by explorers from above. They did everything right; everything perfectly. Sud-
denly, without warning and totally unprovoked, tons of the pit wall immediately above the boys exploded
from the geologic attachment point. And, in a twinkling of an eye, they were gone. The reasons for some
things in life are unknown and unknowable. Perhaps God needed a pair of heroes like these two young men
back in heaven-right now - for another important assignment. And he knew that the rest of us would be
tough enough to handle the heartbreak.
Laughter, and learning, and tributes, and remembrances. All in a single written volume. Quite a publica-
tion indeed.

EDITOR'S
NOTE
F
ifty years ago, NSS member Rane Curl was
reading his latest issue of Accidents in North
American Mountaineering when he had an ex-
cellent idea. Why not create a publication that re-
cords, reports, and analyzes caving accidents, similar
to what the American Alpine Club had been doing
since 1948? And so, in 1967, the National Speleologi-
cal Society began collecting and reporting caving ac-
cidents in what was soon to become one of the NSS's
most popular publications, American Caving Accidents
(ACA).
ACA is more than just the journal of record for
caving accidents in North America. It is a valuable
educational tool for novice and experienced cavers
alike. By reading accident and incident reports, cav-
ers are reminded of, and often introduced to, the
many things that can go wrong underground. Ana-
lytical comments are provided with most of the re-
ports, and a wise caver will take the time to think
about each report carefully. Is the incident something
that could happen to you or to your teammate? Do
you regularly carry the necessary equipment to deal
with the emergencies reported in these pages? Do
you know how to help a fellow caver who is stuck
on rope, halfway up a 200-foot pitch or who has a
fractured ankle?
This special 50th anniversary issue of ACA in-
cludes several feature articles, written by experts in
their fields along with two years of accident reports.
Whether you have been caving since before the first
edition of ACA or you just joined the NSS, I am con-
fident you will find something new, educational, and
interesting in this issue.
At times, it may seem as if this book is one long
promotion for the National Cave Rescue Commis-
sion (NCRC)-several of the contributors are NCRC
instructors, many of the photographs are from NCRC
training events, and you'll find the NCRC mentioned
dozens of times in these pages. This is not intention-
al, but it cannot be helped; the NCRC is the world's
leading cave rescue training organization. Every
year, hundreds of cavers, rescue agency personnel,
and land managers take part in NCRC trainings.
An obvious benefit of this growing interest in
cave rescue is the increasing number of successful,
small party rescues reported to ACA. My favorite
recent example is the incident at Neffs Cave, Utah,
in February, 2016. A caver dislocated his shoulder
after completing several rappels in one of the coun-
try's deepest caves. Unable to climb out on his own,
he was assisted by his teammates, who built coun-
terweight systems and traveling hauls to get him up
four pitches. This was accomplished with gear from
one caver's pack. That caver knew how to build and
operate different types of rescue systems because he
had recently taken the NCRC's Small Party Assisted
Rescue class. In fact, he had taken the class twice. Be-
cause of thoughtful rescue preparedness on the part
of one caver, the patient was out of the cave and on
his way to a hospital in less time than it would take
for the county search and rescue team to even reach
the cave entrance.
A few months later, I saw on social media that
seven cavers, exploring deep within the Binkley Cave
System in Indiana, were overdue, and portions of the
cave were flooding. This was especially troubling
news because some of those cavers are my friends.
Yet I was extremely optimistic. The overdue cavers
were all experienced. They had participated in res-
cue trainings and mock rescue scenarios. The local
cavers who responded were some of the country's
most experienced rescuers. All of that training paid
off. The cavers underground took the appropriate ac-
tions to stay safe and warm while they waited for the
floodwaters to recede, and cavers and land managers
on the surface organized a response that adequately
planned for a full-scale rescue without overtaxing re-
sources unnecessarily.
Looking back on 50 years of ACA, a familiar
message resonates through every issue-under-
standing what can go wrong underground can help
cavers avoid getting in similar situations. But caving
accidents will happen, no matter how careful or pre-
pared we are. I hope in this book that an additional
message comes through-when cavers are trained in
technical rescue and wilderness medicine, the out-
come of a caving accident can be vastly improved.

Fifty Plus Years of Cave Rescue in America
N
ational Collegiate Athletic Association
(NCAA) basketball coach Bob Knight fre-
quently said, "The key is not the will to
win everybody has that. It is the will to prepare to
win that is important." Since its inception the Nation-
al Cave Rescue Commission (NCRC) has been do-
ing just that. It is one of the more respected Internal
Organizations of the National Speleological Society
(NSS), but that has not always been the case. This ar-
ticle will attempt to chronicle the development issues
and victories won by the NCRC as it evolved into
what it is today. The opinions stated are completely
the author's, and right or wrong, are mine and mine
alone.
The buzz in the campground and in various dis-
cussions around the 1965 NSS Convention in Bloom-
ington, Indiana, was the recent tragedy in Schroders
Pants Cave in Manheim, New York, with the death
of James Mitchell. The attempted rescue and failed
body recovery was effected by the National Capital
Grotto Cave Rescue Team, out of Washington, D.C.,
led by Bill Karras. The general opinion was that the
group of cave rescue "heroes" swooping in on Air
Force 2 and the subsequent publicity were an em-
barrassment to the NSS as a whole. In contrast, two
weeks prior to the convention, Jim Dowling, from
Connersville, Indiana, was rescued from Neffs Can-
yon Cave in Utah in a relatively complex multiday
operation performed by local agency and caver per-
sonnel. The ordeal made a small blip in the national
media and was barely mentioned in the convention
discussions.
Karras's general discord with several NSS direc-
tors led to his formation of the Speleological Society
of America (SSA) in 1966. In May 1967 three Hanni-
bal, Missouri, youths, Craig Dowell, 14, his brothers
Bill Hoag, 10, and Joey Hoag, 13, disappeared. A new
road cut near town had opened a cave entrance and
the boys were assumed to be in the cave. Karras, the
president of the SSA and chief of the rescue team, ar-
rived on scene and spent several days talking to the
media. The boys were never found. The media did
not distinguish between the SSA and the NSS. Once
again the excessive publicity of the fiasco added fuel
to the fire against the idea of a national cave rescue
team and cave rescue publicity. The situation reached
a point where the mention of cave rescue organiza-
tions or training resulted a in negative reaction from
the caving community.

Don Paquette NSS 8545
Things related to cave rescue on the national
level calmed down for the next 10 years with rescues
handled at the local level. Walker County Rescue in
Lafayette, Georgia, and Hamilton County Cave and
Cliff Rescue in Chattanooga, Tennessee, handled the
southeastern U.S. Chuck Hempel, Bob Barlow, and
others were doing weekend training in the eastern
U.S. Some Virginia cavers formed the Cave Rescue
Communication Network (CRCN). Triangle Rescue
was operating in southern Virginia, Eastern Tennes-
see, and North Carolina. Local cavers responded
when necessary in Indiana. A national rescue co-
ordinator, with vague duties and responsibilities,
was appointed in the NSS President's department.
Among those holding the position were Ken Laidlaw
from Berkley, California, and Don Black from Chat-
tanooga, Tennessee. The major problem of the era
was conflict between agency personnel, who were
legally responsible for public safety, and cavers, who
were knowledgeable and comfortable working in the
underground environment. Rumors persist amongst
cave rescue personnel today of cavers being held
back at gunpoint while police and firefighters severe-
ly complicated a relatively simple rescue.
In 1976, Dan Smith, a Fire Department Train-
ing Captain and caver from Petaluma, California,
came up with the idea of forming a commission in
the NSS to focus on joint training of agency person-
nel and cavers in cave rescue operations and man-
agement techniques. This would help to "grease the
skids" between cavers and agencies for future rescue
operations. He further divided the country into sepa-
rate regions, each headed by a local commissioner,
to coordinate resources. The initial regional com-
missioners were Rick Rigg, Northwestern; Howard
Hurtt, Western; Perry Denton, Southwestern; Steve
Hudson, Southeastern; Gene Harrison, Eastern; Karl
Kingsley, Northeastern; and Doug Carter, Canada.
The Central Region was vacant. Terry Jones, from
Texas, was appointed the NCRC's Deputy Director
in 1978. Smith was the National Commissioner. The
title of Commissioner was soon changed to Coordi-
nator. The first national training seminar, a five-day
event, was held in San Antonio, Texas, the week prior
to the 1978 NSS Convention in New Braunfels, Texas.
The principle instructors were Smith; Hudson; Butch
Farabee, Chief Rescue Ranger at Grand Canyon Na-
tional Park; Tom Vines; and Dr. John Franklin, Leader
of England's Cave Rescue Organization (CRO). The

when everyone was tired, rather than Friday morn-
ing. After several failed attempts to get the litter over
the Nuisance Drop lip, the mock patient quit and left
the cave. The mock was aborted. The class and the
instructors were very disappointed with the result.
The 1981 NCRC National Weeklong Training
Seminar in Bloomington, Indiana, was an interna-
tional training in conjunction with the International
Congress of Speleology held the following week in
Bowling Green, Kentucky. Several Level 1 students
were to play key roles in the future of the NCRC in-
cluding Dr. Noel Sloan from Indianapolis, Indiana;
Bill Renaker from Fox Lake, Illinois; and Harold
Chrimes from Troutdale, Virginia. Frank Reid from
Bloomington, Indiana, was invited as a guest lecturer
on amateur radio two-meter repeaters and the use of
cave radio location equipment for two-way commu-
nication between the underground and the surface.
Reid enjoyed the seminar SO much that he continued
to teach and contribute until he passed away in 1998.
The first Manual of U.S. Cave Rescue Techniques, edited
by Toni Williams was published and given to the stu-
dents. We decided that the NCRC needed a Training
Coordinator and asked Dave Morrow, an instructor
from Virginia, to take the position. Once again the
mock rescue, held in Doghill Cave in Bedford, Indi-
ana, was started on Thursday evening. During the
mock, the next-door neighbor of the cave owner came
home around midnight with a somewhat inebriated
wife who called the local police and demanded that
the training course personnel be evicted from the
premises immediately. Negotiations with the re-
sponding officer allowed us to stay, as long as ev-
eryone remained quiet. One of the unique things
about the international seminar was that several of
the students were actually very experienced rescuers
in their own countries. At the mock, Mike Meredith
from France led the first team into the cave. We called
them "Bash Teams." It took a few years to replace
"Bash" with the more conservation-leaning "Initial
Response." When he returned, during his debrief,
he pulled a notebook from his pocket where he had
drawn a very accurate sketch map of the entire cave
from the entrance to the patient, and noted every
obstacle and what would be needed for evacuation,
much to the amazement of the observing instruc-
tors. When Meredith paid a return visit to the United
States the following year, we used him for an instruc-
tor at the California weeklong event.
The NCRC National Weeklong Training Semi-
nars continued with modifications to the training.
The seminar schedule was changed to include a
morning classroom and an afternoon fieldwork com-
ponent. The SKEDÂ® litter and Oregon Spine Splint
replaced the very awkward Neill-Robertson litter. In
1982, we finally started the mock on Friday morning.
During the mock rescue at Wind Cave, the haul sys-
tem main anchor moved, resulting in the mock being
aborted for safety. In 1982, Noon resigned as Nation-
al Coordinator, due to job commitments, and was
replaced by Vines. Getting instructors was at times

cian and a radio communication expert who taught
for several years in the region, but he had not taught
at a national weeklong seminar. He went to the NSS
Board of Governors and accused the NCRC of con-
ducting secret meetings and demanded that he be
grandfathered as a certified instructor. In subsequent
discussions with several directors and a meeting
with Tom Rea, NSS Administrative Vice-President,
I assured them that we never had any secret meet-
ings. He simply did not meet our selection criteria
because he had never taught at a national weeklong
seminar. Their review of our policies determined
that we needed to correct the fact that none of the
coordinators had any term limits. Each coordinator,
except the National Coordinator, would have a three-
year term, with potential replacements to be nomi-
nated by their region. The BORC would recommend
the coordinator for confirmation by the NSS Board
of Governors (BOG). There would be no limit on the
number of terms. The BORC decided to certify only
instructors, but to issue certificates of completion to
the students.
Many viewed the NCRC as a group of squab-
bling egomaniacs who wanted to save the world.
In one sense they were correct. We were definitely
squabbling. The Eastern Region wanted NCRC as-
sociation, but also wanted autonomy. Some of the
differences were far reaching. The charter mandated
that we maintain a low profile. The Eastern Region
liked patches, stickers, and publicity. They wanted
vertical requirements to be optional for both students
and instructors. The arguments over grandfathering
instructors continued for over three years, until 1990.
The region was doing some good training, but want-
ing it both ways slighted several BORC members.
The 1988 NCRC Weeklong Training Seminar at
Wind Cave National Park saw the first Level 3. We
had a small overall class, SO during the mock, a few of
the instructors participated with the students to bol-
ster the cadre of rescuers. The second edition of the
Manual of U.S. Cave Rescue Techniques, edited by Steve
Hudson was published.
The 1989 Monteagle, Tennessee, weeklong estab-
lished the beginning of instructor training. Rod Den-
nison put together and taught a two-day pre-seminar
course consisting of construction and use of course
objectives and goals, use of audio-visual equipment,
construction of lesson plans, types of tests, and test
construction, with each person doing an evaluated
mini-presentation. This evolved over the next few
years into the Instructor Qualification (IQ) class, the
weeklong course that prepares instructors for certifi-
cation by the BORC.
In 1991, Emily Davis Mobley broke her leg dur-
ing an expedition in Lechuguilla Cave. The result-
ing rescue took four days. During the operation Ron
Kerbo called me looking for a phone patch, a device
that connects the field phones in the cave to a radio
on the surface, thus allowing someone in the cave
to communicate directly with the remote command
center. I contacted Frank Reid, and he faxed a sche-
matic diagram of the circuit and a parts list to Kerbo.
The parts were bought at a local Radio Shack, and the
patch was constructed and used for the remainder of
the operation. This is yet another example of NCRC
providing resource management.
One of the problems with our training was
dispatching the class for the mock rescue. The class
would completely organize the night before with
all job responsibilities pre-assigned and then arrive
at the cave as one big group. In reality, cave rescues
evolve with people arriving as they get notified with
variable travel time. At the 1991 Schoharie, New York,
weeklong seminar, Bill Renaker arrived at the Friday
morning dispatch meeting with a box of plastic pok-
er chips. Each student had to draw a red, white, or
blue poker chip out of a hat. This randomly divided
the class into three groups that were dispatched 30
minutes apart, providing a much more realistic be-
ginning.
At the NSS Convention the following week in
Cobleskill, New York, I asked Hudson if he would
take over as National Coordinator. The NCRC was
progressing pretty well, we needed a new Medical
Officer, and I was getting burned out. Dr. Sloan be-
came the Medical Officer, and I would return as Cen-
tral Region Coordinator. Hudson agreed to take the
position for a couple of years.
Anmar Mirza came to the 1992 NCRC Weeklong
Training Seminar Marengo, Indiana, as a Level 1 stu-
dent. Anmar was an Emergency Medical Technician
(EMT), amateur radio operator, and caver, and he
had been assisting with Central Region Orientation
to Cave Rescue (OCR) courses for the past few years.
He had more actual cave rescue experience than most
of the instructors on site. As an early 20-something,
he had a fairly short fuse, and I think that at least
three or four times during the week I had to stop him
from packing up and leaving the class. His frustration
was the result of a situation that was starting to brew.
We were instructor-heavy with some that should not
have been cleared to be instructors. The process at
the time was simply to take Levels 1, 2, and 3, then
go to instructor training, and immediately you were
an instructor. Over the years, word got out to many
agencies that the NCRC training was an inexpensive
but high-quality high angle rescue course. We were
getting instructors that did not live anywhere near a
caving area and only came near a cave at a seminar.
Between seminars, their knowledge of the curricu-
lum and the specifics of cave rescue would dimin-
ish. This would result in conflicts between instruc-
tors and students. Also, this seminar made enough
money to allow the NCRC to purchase a trailer for

NSS President, Charles Mohr, of the Reading Public
Museum, visited Dragon Cave with his nature class
in 1934. Dragon Cave was on the Dreibelbis family
property until the early 1940s, when it was sold to
George Lesher. Early on, he was very cordial to cave
explorers. But in the late 1970s, after some boorish
visitors drove through his yard to park at the cave
entrance, Lesher closed the cave to all visitation.
However, he refused to allow township officials
to physically close the cave, which they deemed in
their infinite wisdom to be dangerous. After Lesher's
death, the property was sold and became part of the
Dragons Den Residential Subdivision. With land-
owner permission, the cave remains open today.

Perspectives on Cave Rescue Preplanning
John Punches NSS 39211 & Bonny Armstrong NSS 43003
T
lhe fact that you're reading this issue of American
Caving Accidents suggests you're either a caver
or someone tasked with managing rescues in
caves. In both cases, thinking about and preparing
for rescues will help you to address these challenging
situations more effectively and may help you avoid
the need for complicated rescues in the first place.
This article considers cave rescue preplanning from
a series of perspectives: the individual caver, the
person leading a caving trip, project and expedition
cavers, and the agency or organization responsible
for an organized cave rescue. We'll think about how
cavers can mitigate risk and ensure that they can care
for themselves to the maximum extent feasible, and
how agency or cave resource management personnel
can be best prepared for a rescue.
Caver Preparation
Typical cavers probably aren't thinking about
rescues when they plan a caving trip, but they should
be. Caves are challenging environments, and we
shouldn't brush off the possibility of a mishap. In
fact, we'd argue that it's irresponsible to go caving
without thinking through the objective hazards and
doing what you can to minimize risk.
The best way to avoid the need for a rescue is
to ensure that every member of your caving group
is properly prepared for the trip. What it takes to
be prepared depends on the cave trip itself. A stroll
through easy borehole may require little more prepa-
ration than calling the gang and throwing the gear
in the truck. In contrast, a multiday expedition in a
deep vertical cave could require months of pre-trip
personal and group effort to ensure all the bases are
covered. Preparation for any trip should start with a
clear understanding of the challenges that the cave
will (or could) present. Trip members should then
undertake appropriate physical conditioning and
ensure that their caving skillset is up to the task and
that all personal and group equipment is ready. The
following checklist will help you to cave safely-r
that it starts well in advance of the actual cave trip.
Checklist for Caver Preparation
Well in advance and ongoing:
Engage in regular physical activity. Cardiovascular
conditioning, strength, and agility are invaluable at-
tributes while caving, and they do much to mitigate
risk of injury.
Obtain and use cave-worthy clothing, footwear,
and protective equipment. Learn what is appropriate
for differing types of cave trips. Make sure your gear
works well for you.
Invest in high quality caving lights. Experiment
with them SO you'll know how long you can expect
batteries to last, and plan accordingly. Learn how to
implement field repairs. Always carry extra lights.
If you plan to engage in vertical caving, obtain a
real caving ascending system, seek qualified help
tuning it to your body size and configuration, and
practice until you can ascend, perform a changeover,
and descend smoothly. Learn how to pass knots, pro-
tect yourself on traverses and approach lines, transfer
from one rope to another, and downclimb. These are
essential skills that should be mastered before you
go in the cave. (See the Vertical Caving Notes, at the
conclusion of this article, for more on this subject.)
Prior to the trip:
Get details from your trip leader about what to ex-
pect (nature of cave, objectives, route, difficulty, du-
ration).
Check and pack gear, lights and supplies. Make
sure all is in good working order and that you have
everything needed.
Assemble a Palmer Furnace kit (large trash bag,
candle, flame source) and learn how to use it.
Tell friends and family where you are going, what
route you'll take to and in the cave, and when you an-
ticipate returning. Give them the contact information
for your surface watch (which should be established
by the trip leader).
Ensure that you are rested, hydrated, and as healthy
as possible. Starting a cave trip already fatigued or
dehydrated heightens your risk.
Pack sensibly. Carrying too much (weight or bulk)
can prevent you from moving efficiently. You'll wear
out sooner, and fatigue is a major precursor to caving
injuries.
Tell your caving companions and trip leader about
any medical conditions you have, what they should
watch for, and how they should assist you if need-
ed.
Know what to do if you get separated from your
caving group.
While caving:
Cave at an appropriate pace. Pushing physically and
mentally is why many of us go caving, but overdoing
it can put us at risk individually and as a group.

that hand and footholds will be prone to breakage,
and that chock-stone features could fail under your
weight. In heavily traveled passages, other cavers
have probably "cleaned" the route for you. If you're
working in less traveled areas, you should be more
cautious.
Rig your trade routes in anticipation of a rescue-or
at least ensure that they are suitable for multi-person
loads. This makes it much easier to assist an injured
colleague through technical sections of passage. This
can include making modifications to constrictions in
advance rather than waiting until a rescue or assist is
needed. Rescue-worthy rigging and passage modifi-
cation have the added benefits of speeding up travel
through these areas and reducing the effort and com-
plexity of travel (and thus reducing the risk of injury
or fatigue-related problems).
Pre-position cave rescue equipment, food, water,
shelter, and insulation at logical locations in the cave.
A warming kit near your dig or bolting site, and extra
rope near vertical pitches, can be invaluable. The types
of equipment you'll need will depend on the nature
of the cave, how easy it would be to obtain equip-
ment and supplies from the surface, and the objec-
tives of your caving activities. We encourage you to be
thoughtful and to plan for reasonable contingencies.
Caves can be challenging and unpredictable. Cavers can mitigate risk through preparation, training, and thoughtful planning. Photo by Chris Higgins.
If you are modifying cave passage, particularly
if through digging or blasting, make sure you have
qualified personnel guiding those efforts. Spend time
evaluating the rock or other material you 11 be remov-
ing and think about what happens to overlying ma-

shore up areas with wood or rock (much as would
occur in a mine).
Long trips underground require us to deal with
human waste. Ideally, you'd pack it out, but this
may not always be feasible. If you dispose of human
waste in the cave, be very careful you don't inadver-
tently contaminate your underground water sources.
You'l need to be very cognizant of the cave's hydrol-
ogy and take measures to prevent spread of waste-
born disease on footwear, clothing, or skin (hands).
If you need to drink from in-cave water sources, filter
or purify your water.
Fatigue can be a huge issue for expedition and push
cavers. Manage it by balancing cave pack weight ver-
sus number of trips, pacing yourselves, and break-
ing large groups into smaller units (with people who
move at similar speeds) to minimize delay at vertical
pitches and constrictions. It's also important to plan
for (and take) rest days when needed. Pushing too
close to your limits is an invitation for an accident.

rigging challenges, and understand your incident
management system. You can accomplish this by
establishing working relationships with local cav-
ers/grottos and rescue agencies. Prepare cavers to
work effectively under your chain of command. Pre-
pare rescuers to be effective in the cave environment
(insist they be properly equipped and able to move
effectively in-cave). If you are an agency that both
manages caves and performs cave rescues, invest the
time and funds necessary to ensure that your person-
nel are properly trained and equipped for the unique
requirements of cave rescue.
If you're accustomed to managing aboveground
incidents, anticipate that cave incidents will have
less efficient communications, require a higher level
of inter-task collaboration, and that personnel may
need to shift from one task to another as the mission
unfolds underground. A search team may initiate
medical treatment, then be absorbed into an evacua-
tion task force. They will all rely on the communica-
tions system established and staffed by others, and
they will likely need the support of rigging personnel
to overcome obstacles.
Test your incident management procedures us-
ing mock rescues in your caves. You will probably
find that you need to tweak your management struc-
ture for it to work effectively for cave incidents. An-
ticipate the need for wired communication systems
(UHF and VHF radios have limited range under-
ground). Establish entrance control to manage and
document personnel ingress and egress, and to keep
persons not involved in the rescue from interfering.
Adapt search techniques to the cave environment.
Have a cave rescue cache suited to your cave. Antici-
pate that some rescue equipment may be best staged
in the cave, but rotate it out periodically for inspec-
tion and cleaning. Seal in-cave equipment to protect
it from moisture and decay. Rotate out water and
food items and any expired medical supplies.
Develop specific rigging preplans for major ac-
cess routes in cave. Test the plans and refine them.
This will save critical time and enhance safety during
actual rescues.
In some cases, a cave destination accessible to
healthy cavers may be impassable to a litter. Know
this in advance. In many cases, it will be acceptable to
remove the patient from the litter to get them through
a restriction. Your preplan should identify appropri-
ate alternatives.
Some passages will be SO restrictive that you'll
have to modify them in order to get an injured per-
son through them. Identifying theses passages in ad-
vance is important. If the passage is on a major route,
we recommend that it be modified in advance SO that
a rescue could be performed if needed. If the route
is used infrequently, or would be easy to modify in
the event of a rescue, have a plan for what needs to
be done and ensure that you have the tools and re-
sources (and skilled personnel) readily available. If
the restrictive route can be avoided, plan an alterna-
tive exit path.
The NCRC, while not a cave rescue team itself,
trains hundreds of persons in cave rescue techniques
annually and maintains caches of specialized cave
rescue equipment. Agencies and cave management
organizations can call upon the NCRC to help them
identify trained personnel as a part of preplanning
efforts, and its cave rescue equipment can be made
available for incidents. We encourage rescue plan-
ners to contact their NCRC Regional Coordinator
well in advance of actual incident needs, SO that ap-
propriate call-out and equipment sharing protocols
can be implemented. Coordinator contact informa-
tion is available at NCRC.info.
Vertical Caving Notes
If you travel almost anywhere else in the world,
cavers use standardized personal vertical systems
and are trained to specific standards before their cav-
ing associations allow them to do much in the verti-
cal environment. Not SO in the United States. Here
we tend to build our own unique ascending systems
out of whatever parts are available shiny), and it's
not uncommon for someone to begin vertical caving
with no formal single-rope-technique (SRT) training
whatsoever. It's not our intent to force standardiza-
tion upon American cavers, but we'd like to make an
appeal for a few things that can significantly improve
personal SRT safety.
First, use only static kernmantle rope with a tight-
ly woven sheath when rigging fixed lines for in-cave
vertical pitches. Limit use of dynamic (rock-climbing)
ropes to actual lead climbing activities and never de-
pend on hardware store utility rope. Cave ropes tend
to be stiff (which some people don't like), but that stiff-
ness results from the rope's dense sheath, which im-
proves abrasion resistance and actually makes climb-
ing with a caving ascending system easier and more
efficient. Invest in good rope, treat it well, and you'll
be able to use it safely for many, many trips.
Use a real caving ascending system. Cave en-
vironments are challenging, and ascending systems
cobbled together out of miscellaneous rock-climbing
and/or rescue equipment are unlikely to serve you
well. The NCRC strongly recommends each caver ob-
tain one of the following systems: frog, Mitchell, Tex-
as, or single or double bungee ropewalker. These are
arguably the most common systems for caving. They
should incorporate two gripping points of attachment
(toothed ascenders) connected to the main rigging
point on the wearer's harness.

ilar to the Petzl STOP or Simple. Practice with them
on stiff, muddy caving rope and learn how to lock
them off. Too many people try to use rock-climbing
rappel or belay devices (like ATCs or GriGris) for
caving. This is a potentially dangerous situation, as
the gear simply isn't designed for the extremes of the
cave environment and may not function effectively
in your time of need.
When you clip into a horizontal line (such as a
traverse or approach line), clip in with a carabiner to
the rope rather than just a toothed ascender. Toothed
ascenders are not designed for transverse loads, and if
cross-loaded they can detach from, or even sever, the
rope under shock load. This is precisely the situation
in which we often see them used improperly a caver
will ascend to the top of a pitch, then clip one of their
ascenders into a horizontal line leading away from the
pitch. If they fall during the transition from climb to
traverse, they will shock load their ascender in a cross-
loaded configuration. In cases where the horizontal
line is anchored at both ends, it is better to clip in us-
ing a cowstail carabiner (with gate facing away from
the rock). If that line is on a slope, a caver can clip in
with their cowstail carabiner (to take the load) and as-
cender (to capture progress as they move upslope).

lhud! "Uggh." I heard it above me in Cyclops
Cave-the sound of coverall-covered flesh
smacking limestone. Fortunately, the caver
had fallen backward, wedging himself across the top
of the canyon. He had a death grip on his rack, which
was still rigged to the rope, but no longer attached to
him. For one of a number of possible reasons, he had
become detached from his descender, his only point
of connection with the rope.
Stories like this are not uncommon in ACA re-
ports. Though not frequent, this type of accident is
a recurring theme throughout the years of ACA sta-
tistics. In 1991, in one of the best-known examples,
Chris Yeager fell 23 meters to his fate in Cueva Ch-
eve in Oaxaca, Mexico. The next caver down the rope
found Yeager's rack still rigged in at a rebelay.
In both of these cases, the caver experienced a
freak occurrence of a cross-load or rollout failure.
The Cyclops caver was in the process of crossing a
simple, non-free hanging rebelay. He rigged his rack,
fiddled with the bars, and removed his cowstail from
the rebelay anchor. When he sat down on the rack,
he quickly realized it was no longer attached to him,
but by then it was too late. Somehow, in the fiddling
and reaching, his screw-lock carabiner had become
unlocked. Then, in the process of load transfer at
the rebelay, the rack eye was able to lever open the
carabiner gate. Fortunately, in this instance the cav-
er's quick reflexes and the geometry of the pit were
enough to save the day.
Metal rappel devices connected to metal D-links
on a harness by another piece of metal hardware
(usually a carabiner) represent a chain of three hard
links. When such a chain is subjected to cyclic load-
ing (weighting and unweighting), it can often end
up in less than ideal configurations. In the situations
described above, the carabiners became unlocked, ei-
ther in the process of cyclic loading or at some time
before the accident. When a carabiner is unlocked, a
descender can often push in on the outside of the gate
and open it, usually while unloading the descender.
If this is not discovered while it is happening, then
the descender can slip right out of the carabiner when
it is reweighted.
When a chain of three hard links gets re-weight-
ed, catastrophe can result-either from an unlocked
gate, or from complete failure of the gate by lever ac-
tion even when the carabiner is locked. This happens
when the chain gets cross-loaded or twisted during
The Rappel Test
A Test You Can't Fail
the unweighting. When the cross-loaded or twisted
chain gets loaded again, the descender (especially a
full-size rack) can exert a lever force on the carabi-
ner gate, breaking it or the locking sleeve while the
carabiner is locked. In this issue of ACA, there is a
report (on page 72) of a caver in Kentucky breaking
the screw lock sleeve on his rack carabiner and fall-
ing the last 10 feet of a 97 foot rappel.
Because of the risk of rollout failure, many cav-
ers use a screw link instead of a carabiner as their
rack connection. A 7-mm oval maillon rapide is an
especially popular choice for this connection because
its dimensions are too narrow to allow a cross-load.
These links are rated to 25 kN, which is comparable
to many carabiners used for the same purpose, and
they can be lightly wrenched shut. It is important to
note that while a small screwlink is a good solution
for a rack, it is dangerous to use a small screwlink
as a bobbin connection. Bobbins are made to be at-
tached with a large-stock carabiner, and screwlinks
can move around in the opening and actually cause
the latch to open. Other ways of preventing rollout
include using double carabiners for the rack con-
nection or using a cowstail clipped into the rack as
a backup.
However, even if you take all of the precautions
described above to protect your descender attach-
ment, there are many other ways that your descender
can fail. One of these is a backward threading of rack
bars known as a "suicide rig" or a "zipper." Other
ways to screw up when loading a descender include
but are not limited to; failing to close a bobbin, load-
ing a descender that is attached to a gear loop or belt
loop, attaching to the incorrect side of a rope rigged
for a pull-down, or even just slipping at the edge and
immediately falling into an out of control rappel.
Fortunately, there is a test that can prevent any
and all of these situations from being deadly: a rap-
pel test. A rappel test involves maintaining a second
point of attachment until the descent control device
has been "tested." The rappel test is a rappeller's pre-
flight checklist. The test proves that the rappel device
is rigged and functions properly. The test catches
many mistakes that may lead to serious accidents. By
temporarily adding a second point of attachment, a
rappel test allows us to test the integrity and opera-
tion of our descent control device, allowing it to fail
without serious consequence. Any failure of the de-
scender or its attachment will result in load transfer

Fourth, stow the safety device (QAS or cow-
stail). Maintaining predictable gear organization in-
creases safety and efficiency. Being able to stow (and
draw) a QAS with one hand is a valuable skill and
can be accomplished with thoughtful gear organiza-
tion and practice. Ideally, any device considered a
QAS should be operable with only one hand.
Fifth and finally, unlock and rappel with cau-
tious confidence.
Rappelling is one of the only times that many
North American cavers will routinely commit to a
single point of attachment to the rope. It is prudent
that we take a little extra care to test and confirm the
integrity of our system before committing to that
single point. A rappel test should be performed ev-
ery time an unloaded descender is to be loaded. If a
descender is unloaded at a rebelay or ledge, the caver
should first complete a new rappel test before con-
tinuing.
Take the rappel test every time. Make it a habit-
even on those low-angle slopes and short drops. It's a
test that, if taken properly, is impossible to fail.

loses the venous pump sending blood back to the
heart. Instead, this blood pools in the legs, leaving
less blood for the heart to circulate to the kidneys, the
heart itself, and most importantly the brain.
So why would someone have problems after
hanging too long? Since blood is pooling in the legs,
it is not circulating back to the heart and lungs where
oxygen is replaced. Muscles can function without
oxygen for a remarkably long time but not forever.
Muscle cells eventually die. When they do, both
potassium and muscle en-
zymes can leak out of mus-
cle cells. In the short term,
potassium is dangerous to
the heart and in the long-
term muscle enzymes are

In 2011 at Ellison's Cave, two people died on
rope. One rigged the Warm Up pit in the water then
descended. He did not reach bottom and indicated
he was having trouble. Communication was nearly
impossible. While waiting for outside help, another
man descended to try to help but could not and got
stuck himself. How long they were suspended is
hard to say, but the estimates are about 45 minutes
for each before all communication ceased. Autopsy
reports say they died of suspension trauma, but that
is a debatable point. The time frame is consistent with
both a suspension trauma death and hypothermia
from being in the waterfall, but certainly the hypo-
thermia put them at higher risk for an on-rope faint
given their decreasing movement.
In the March 2016 Ellison's Cave incident in this
ACA, a man made it 100 feet up Fantastic Pit, in the
water, before having to stop. This was a perfect set
up for a suspension trauma death, much like the ones
described by the French. He was exhausted and cold
and likely dehydrated. In this case though, the man's
partner was able to climb up and perform a pick off.
This may well have
saved his life. At the
2011 Ellison's incident,
the pick off (if that was
even the intent) did not
work, and a second
person died. A pick off
is something that is dif-
ficult to do unless prac-
ticed constantly. Kudos
to the 2016 partner for
doing it successfully.

In Carroll Cave,
a person ascending a
ladder felt faint and
then passed out. Given
that she was actively
climbing at the time, it
is unlikely that she suf-
fered from blood pool-
ing in her legs. How-
ever, once she fainted
but remained upright,
she was at high risk
for consequences. Cav-
ers there quickly used
a winch to pull her up
the rest of the way.
Faced with a suspension emergency, we as ver-
tical cavers need to have a plan. OSHA insists on the
worksite that there be a plan for saving someone
stuck on rope. Cavers need to be prepared as well.
In the Carroll Cave incident described in this issue
of ACA, they had a plan and implemented it quickly.
That person walked away doing well.
Of course, the first line of defense is prevention.
We need to use appropriate gear and practice the
rope work we will do underground. Preparation goes
a long way. Failing that, we need to be able to lower

Small Party Assisted Rescue
An Emerging Cave Rescue Philosophy
S
mall Party Assisted Rescue (SPAR) is a disci-
pline and a philosophy that stems from several
guiding principles. It builds from the idea that
the most important task in a cave rescue is to move
the patient to the entrance of the cave, as quickly
and as safely as possible, arriving in stable or better
condition than that in which he was found. In many
cases, the best way to accomplish these goals is for
the patient's own caving party to begin, conduct, and
in some cases, even complete the rescue with the per-
sonnel and gear that are available to them.
The concept of Small Party Assisted Rescue
was created by the National Cave Rescue Commis-
sion (NCRC) to combine into a single discipline the
ideas of "Self-Rescue" and "Small-Party Rescue."
Self-rescue refers to rescue by the affected cave team
without calling in outside resources, and small-party
rescue refers to any rescue that can be accomplished
by a small team, typically consisting of six or fewer
people. The "A" in SPAR implies that the patient is
able to assist with his own rescue. A SPAR patient
can often assist by crawling or scooting through the
cave, ascending or descending ropes, or even provid-
ing some extra help in hauling himself on some res-
cue systems.
Throughout the years, cavers have often res-
cued themselves. In many cases, self-rescue emerges
as the best way for cavers to help an injured or ill
team member. In many areas in North America, even
a callout rescue will still be a small-party response
by necessity. What has changed over the last decade
is recognition of these facts. The idea of SPAR has
gained greater acceptance from the organized rescue
community as a valid and often preferred response
to caving incidents.
As a leader in the field of cave rescue train-
ing, the NCRC has developed and begun teaching
a SPAR curriculum in a three- to five-day format.
These courses provide formalized training that cav-
ers can use to conduct SPARs with a greater level of
technical competence. These classes are currently in
high demand, and spaces often fill quickly. NCRC
SPAR courses have prerequisites of basic knowledge
in knots and single-rope technique (SRT), and stu-
dents must demonstrate proficiency in both in order
to participate. The primary audience is cavers, but
the courses have also become popular with canyoneers,
climbers, cave search-and-rescue (SAR) teams, industri-
al rope technicians, bat biologists, and mine explorers.
Andy Armstrong NSS 45993
A SPAR response is often necessary when cav-
ers are in remote locations, too far for organized cave
rescue teams to respond and be effective in a timely
manner. In many situations, because of the patient's
condition or the environmental conditions in the
cave, waiting many hours for rescue is not a realistic
option. For example, many alpine and high-latitude
caves are much too cold for cavers to survive for ex-
tended periods without specialized bivouac gear.
Even in the U.S., rescues to these caves and to remote
locations within extensive cave systems often require
a multi-hour response time- there is a rescue team
available at all.
In any caving incident, the patient's medical sit-
uation should drive the decisions as to what rescue
actions to take. This includes the decision of whether
to even attempt a SPAR. Self-rescue is only appro-
priate in specific medical circumstances, and a SPAR
response may not be appropriate when the patient
has severe injuries, is unconscious, or has a possible

Critical thinking is vital to the SPAR mindset.
Caver-rescuers must be situationally aware and think
critically about their situation, carefully weighing
each variable. These variables include patient condi-
tion, team condition, distance to the entrance, avail-
able gear, and the physical obstacles between the in-
jured party and the cave entrance. Cavers conducting
a SPAR must continually monitor each variable and
adapt to changing conditions as the rescue evolves.
SPAR is not mutually exclusive with callout
rescue. There can be a hybrid response somewhere
between the two. In many cases, a rescue can begin
as a SPAR response until responders arrive. Cavers
can be dispatched to the surface to call for resources
immediately after the injury or at any point later in
the evacuation. Sometimes, even if the caving party
is unable to deliver the patient all the way to the sur-
face, they can at least move the patient a considerable
distance toward that goal. Any amount of distance
covered by a SPAR response will make the evacua-
tion that much easier for responders when they ar-
rive.
With SPAR, the overriding philosophy is more
important than the actual techniques. While much of
a SPAR response will be non-technical, it is the tech-
nical vertical problems that require the most train-
ing and practice. For a technique to be considered
appropriate, it must be operable by a small team of
rescuers. Ideally, SPAR vertical rescue techniques
should be operable by a single rescuer. Some haul-
ing and lowering techniques that meet these criteria
are counterweighted hauls, in-line traveling hauls,
MÃ¼nter hitch lowers, releasable redirects, conver-
sion of a loaded line to lower, movement of a patient
through rebelays, and pickoffs. The current NCRC
SPAR curriculum focuses on these systems and chal-
lenges cavers to accomplish all of them in realistic
situations with their own minimal gear.
Out of necessity, SPAR rescue systems are built
with an absolute minimum of gear. SPAR systems use
whatever gear is available to the caving party, which
is often a meager cache made up of small rescue pul-
leys and prusiks, components of personal SRT sys-
items, and whatever can be scavenged from rigging
that exists in the cave. Techniques that require spe-
cialized gear not normally carried by cavers will be
unavailable as options in most real incidents. SPAR
philosophy encourages cavers to think preventively
as rescuers to make SPAR responses possible, reason-
ably safe, and reasonably efficient. This mindset re-
quires cavers to plan and prepare for rescue not only
mentally, but also with adjustments to their vertical
systems and to what they consider standard safety
gear to be carried on every trip.

cavers to build safe, effective rescue systems with

rope grab device, and one pulley. If each member of
even a two- or three-person caving party carries a res-
cue kit like this, the possibilities really start to open
up for what can be built and operated underground.
Rope, webbing, and hardware that could potentially
be used in a rescue can be conserved by following
a minimalist rigging mindset from the outset of the
caving trip. For example, gear used in rigging one lo-
cation is not available for use somewhere else in the
cave when an emergency occurs. The rescue-ready
SPAR philosophy encourages rope-only anchors
where appropriate instead of needlessly using web-
bing and hardware. A carabiner that seems superflu-
ous while rigging an entrance pit could be worth its
weight in gold deeper into the cave when an accident
happens.
By using concepts from traditional cave rescue
pared down to their essentials, in tandem with a wil-
derness medicine mindset, cavers can often effect a
successful cave rescue on their own. In any cave res-
cue, we must remember that the rest of the patient's
life lies on the other side of the cave entrance. Our
ultimate goal is to get the patient out of the cave
as quickly and safely as possible. In many caving
incidents, a SPAR response will be the best way to
achieve this outcome.

Fortunately, Sue made a full recovery from this inci-
dent. She is still interested in caving.
A little more research on POTS shows that this
syndrome may not be as rare as first thought. Sta-
tistics estimate that between one and three million
Americans may have it. The current diagnostic crite-
rion is an increase in heart rate of 30 beats per min-
ute or more within the first ten minutes of standing.
Symptoms can include a decrease in blood pressure
when standing, fatigue, headaches, nausea, and even
chest pain. POTS is most often seen in women from
age 15 to 50, but it can affect anyone. Learn more
here: www.dysautonomiainternational.org.
Next time you rig a pit, cliff, training site, or any-
thing else where someone will be on rope, consider
how you could get a stuck person off rope quickly.
Playing the "what if" game in your mind will help
you to be better prepared if an emergency occurs.
That's where contingency rigging comes in. If you
plan for an emergency when you rig your ropes, and
then someone has a problem on rope, then you don't
even need extra gear to make the situation better, as
you've already set up your rope in anticipation of an
emergency.

capabilities to primary operational authorities (task-

The History
(BCSF) was incorporated in 1978. In 1984, recogniz-
ing the need for organized cavers to reduce risks and
develop a self-rescue capability, members of the BC
caving community informally established BC Cave
Rescue (BCCR) as a training and cave rescue response
service. Phil Whitfield, NSS 12901 RL,FF was instru-
mental in the creation of organized cave rescue here
and served as the Cave Rescue Coordinator in British
Columbia for many years since its formation.
mys, in 1991 and the subsequent recovery operation,
BCCR was recognized as an instrumental component
in the rescue framework. In 1992, a Memorandum
of Understanding signed by BCCR, the Provincial
Emergency Program, the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police and the BC Ambulance Service recognized
BCCR as the lead organization for cave rescue in the
province. Since that time, BCCR has operated as a

provincial caving society of the time didn't want re-
sponsibility for rescue services. This was unlike the
model in BC and in Quebec where the rescue service
was a subcomponent of the organized caving federa-
tion. As such, the Alberta Cave Rescue Organization
(ACRO) was formed separately in 2001 by cavers and
members of Alberta SAR groups.
ACRO and BCCR have become closely associ-
ated, more formally since 2007, and adopting a com-
mon logo and using the name Alberta/British Co-
lumbia Cave Rescue Service (ABCCRS) in 2011. The
relationship was further solidified during exercise
"Dark Squeeze," a massive interprovincial cave-res-
cue exercise at Gargantua cave, under the Alberta/BC
border. A memorandum of understanding (MOU)
between the societies was signed to formally share a
common membership list, logo, public name (ABC-
CRS), and policies and procedures.
The combined group is capable of responding to
cave rescue emergencies anywhere in Western Cana-
da, and could even be a resource to the Northwestern
United States and Alaska. My counterpart in British
Columbia, Doug Munroe, has used the phrase "Cave
rescue is by cavers, for everyone," to describe our
service, reflecting the organized caving community's
commitment to the public, which includes all who
venture into caves to explore.
Separated by 3,500 kilometers to the least, our
friends in the SociÃ©tÃ© quÃ©bÃ©coise de spÃ©lÃ©ologie had
been evolving their own caving society and rescue
capability. The SQS formed in 1970 and soon after
formed L'Ãcole quÃ©bÃ©coise de spÃ©lÃ©ologie (The Que-
bec School of Speleology). The school began instruct-
ing in technical caving topics, including rescue, and
provides a core group of trained cave rescuers within
the SQS that can respond to caving emergencies in
Quebec and Eastern Canada. Indeed the skills taught
have also proved valuable in providing self-rescue
capabilities to the SQS expeditions in Central and
South America.
Training
In 1987, BCCR offered a week-long training
seminar in cave rescue organization and techniques,
similar to the NCRC seminars. The seminar, 80 hours
in length, is now offered biennially. In 1995, BCCR
began to offer annual training workshops in accident
prevention and small-party self-rescue techniques,
and since 2007, consecutive Companion Rescue and
Rescue Response Workshops have been delivered
over two weekends each spring in both BC and Al-
berta. Since ABCCRS training began, over 800 indi-
viduals have participated, and, almost all of the most
active cavers in the area and over half of all the indi-
viduals within the area's caving societies have been
exposed to accident prevention and rescue prepared-
ness training. Training to members in Incident Com-

The SQS operates its own training and rescue

Through various two-day courses SQS members car

cue training.
As alpine caving techniques used in Canadian
cave exploration have moved toward a more Euro-
pean style of rigging, using thinner ropes and with
more reliance on rebelays and deviations, SO have ou
rescue techniques. In recent years we have shifted to
include the European methods such as those present-
ed in the Cave Rescuer's Manual published by the SpÃ©-

on counterweight techniques and the incorporation
of bobbin-style descenders and cammed ascenders
into rescue raising/lowering systems has been a big
shift for us. A benefit we see is that using items in
rescue systems such as the Petzl STOP and cammed
ascenders that northern cavers are already familiar
with reduces training time and increases proficiency

Conclusion
Maintaining a capability for cave rescue in Can-
ada is a challenge due to the vast territory, dispersed
resources, and scattered people. But, we have a sys-
tem that has proven itself in the callouts we have SO
far been required to undertake. Key to the success has
been to integrate rescue responsibilities and training
within the caving community. With that, rescue and
risk management considerations are likely to be at
the forefront of cavers' minds, thus helping influ-
ence people to make good decisions underground.
Though, more people are taking to the outdoors and
to the underground. With that we hope the infrequent
nature of cave rescues is maintained in the future and
the need for our services continues to be limited.

manifest themselves in the days or weeks to follow.
Caving often forces us to conquer our fears and
push our mental and psychological envelopes if we
want to succeed. But the very same character traits
that make us good cavers and cave rescuers can also
make it difficult for us to cope with or even talk about
Post Traumatic Stress Disorders.
Our good, bad, and ugly reactions to the trauma
that we are exposed to as cave rescuers are all inter-
locking pieces of the same complex psychological
jigsaw puzzle.
Laura Demarest, a 34-year-old project caver
from Bloomfield, Indiana, has spent the last four
years trying to piece together her own complicated
jigsaw puzzle after a good friend suffered a heart at-
tack and died during a routine 2013 caving trip in
Indiana.
"We were just walking along in chest-deep wa-
ter, hauling scuba gear. We were two miles into the
cave, without a care in the world," she said. "When
I looked back and saw that Tim was face down in the
water, I thought it was just a prank. I was very con-
fused and thought maybe it was a seizure as I tried to
drag him back to a small gravel bar. We did CPR for 3
or 4 hours. No one wanted to be the one to say it was
time to stop. When we finally did, we just sat there
for hours. Awaiting rescue. With our dead friend."
As it goes with many recoveries, Demarest
remembered that her very first reaction was one
grounded in anger. "On the way out of the cave, I
wanted to grab the cave formations I saw and break
them. I had a lot of anger about the way the recovery
was handled. I did eventually get past that."
But then came the guilt. "I felt bad because I was
still here and Tim wasn't," she confided.
"I was raised to believe that until you reached
a saturation point, it wasn't okay to show emotion.
My family was never really about lying down on a
couch and talking through problems. We were raised
to pull ourselves up by our own bootstraps. But I've
found that sometimes that is just not enough."
That same stoic, blue-collar work ethic and no-
nonsense, Mid-Western upbringing that made De-
marest such a strong and driven caver also made it
difficult for her to share the feelings of worry and
dread that plagued her on subsequent caving trips.
"I became a horrible mother to the folks I
was caving with. I worried every time one of them
coughed suddenly, or even leaned back suddenly.
Anything weird that went on with someone (in a
cave), I assumed that they were going to die. It was
taking the fun out of caving for me. I'd get teary-eyed
on trips and hang out in the back SO no one would
see," she said.
Though it did help her to find out later that there
wasn't really anything that anyone on site could have

done to change the outcome, it wasn't until she de-
cided to pursue cave rescue training through the
National Cave Rescue Commission (NCRC) that she
began to put the pieces together.
"Cave rescue training was my medicine, as
hokey as that sounds," she said. "My Level 1 NCRC
training brought up a lot of feelings. I had to sur-
render control, had to fight through it. I wanted to
become a human Swiss Army knife. It really helped
being around others who'd been through it. It was
helpful to be surrounded by my cave rescue peers."
In late 2016, that cave rescue training paid off
when Demarest and a group of six other experienced
cavers were trapped by unexpected rising waters for
36 hours during a survey trip. And while for many
cavers, a second cave trip involving a rescue might
have triggered some debilitating emotional respons-
es, it had the opposite effect on Demarest. "You have
all that shit in the bottom of your pack for years, but
you never think you'll use it. But suddenly you do
and it's worth it. My cave rescue training gave me
enough confidence to stay put. I've gotten stronger
as a result." While waiting for the water to recede,
Laura said she felt the tug of anxiety when she heard
the sound of dripping water, which sent her mind
racing back to the time she spent alone with her

ways to go," he said.
"We also used to wait for folks to reach out for

tive and reach out to our members first," he added.
But just what constitutes a "normal" reaction
to a traumatic event? That can differ from person to
person, and there is no such thing as a universally ac-
cepted set of behaviors or time frame when it comes
to dealing with trauma.
Allen Padgett, cave rescue veteran and coauthor
of the vertical cavers' bible, On Rope, has developed
his own coping strategies to deal with the unhappy
endings over the decades.
"One of my coping mechanisms is to not know
or remember the subject's name. It simply becomes
another body in a zippered bag," he said.
"Another is to either call or send my father (who
was a Methodist pastor) an e-mail describing the en-
tire operation. This allows me the chance to put sub-
stance to my emotions and speak of them. My father
died over 10 years ago. After any traumatic call I still
send him an e-mail. Somehow it does not bounce
back SO I feel like he still gets them. Luckily a few
tears won't short out a keyboard."
Disassociation is a common coping mechanism
for rescuers, but one that is sometimes impossible
to attain given the nature of the call. Sometimes, we
have to get up close and personal with our subjects
and/or their families. This too can contribute to lin-
gering feelings that we'd rather not face.
Padgett knows this all too well.
"One of the worst [recoveries] was one where I
never laid a hand on the body," he said. "I was the
agency representative for the Georgia Department of
Natural Resources and it fell to me to communicate
with the family. The subject was stuck on rope in a
deep cave waterfall (Incredible Pit in Ellison's Cave),
but we had not yet retrieved the body and confirmed
death. I kept my professional face on when, over the
phone, I told the mother that her son was indeed de-
ceased. I will never forget that scream that followed.
After telling the father as well, I was able to end the
call. At that point I walked away from the command
post and said a prayer for them all, then cried my
eyes out. I walked a bit and came back to handle my
responsibilities for the rest of the rescue."
Padgett estimates that he has been on 46 recov-
eries and has avoided any lingering negative emo-
tional damage to his psyche-so far.
"But the next one may be the straw that breaks
the camel's back. No nightmares now, but I can pic-
ture in my mind's eye every one of the 46. Those im-
ages cannot be unseen."
Padgett credits a routine that he's developed
over the years as the reason he's been able to keep
the wolves of despair at bay.
"Luckily over the years I was able to decompress
after each one. I would take a 'mental health day' and
simply go for a long walk in the woods. No alcohol.
No drugs. No fatty foods. No caffeine. Just eat well,
get exercise and quality rest. Works for me," he said.
Padgett's strategy for success, though it may
not work for everyone, pointedly avoids a common
post-traumatic event coping mechanism: substance
abuse.
Cavers and rescuers often have the reputation
as being the kind of folks who work hard and play
harder. But how does the layperson differentiate be-
tween someone having a good time versus someone
who is seeking to escape the reality in which a trau-
matic experience has imprisoned them? How does
one even know if someone is using drugs or alcohol
for recreation versus alienation? Especially given the
sporadic nature of interaction that is part and parcel
of volunteer cave rescue?
In other words, how can we tell the difference
between the unfortunate (but normal) post-traumatic
reactions to tragedy and those that are the hallmarks
of a debilitating post-traumatic stress disorder?
The Difference Between a Post-Traumatic Stress
Reaction and a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
Post-traumatic stress reactions have no expira-
tion date. They may affect us for a few short hours, or
they may be with us for the rest of our lives.
Steve T. Davis, the Stewardship Chair of the
Southeastern Cave Conservancy, still deals with
some post-traumatic stress from a rescue he helped
perform several years ago.
"The Valhalla tragedy has haunted me ever
since it happened," he said.
"I rappelled down and helped with the recov-
ery. My hands are shaking and my face is full of emo-
tion even as I type this. I spent many hours in the pit
digging and moving rock to remove the two guys. I
recall clearly the smells and dealing with their body
fluids. A bad scene. One of the hardest things I did
was climb up the rope. Exhausted, having to rest too
often and think about-well everything. I have been
to Valhalla many times since then. Perhaps dozens.
I have never been back to the bottom. I have taken
many pictures hanging off the top and have done
many other pits. Just not that one. I don't need to go
back down there. Nowadays I blame it on me being
too out of shape but that's not the real reason."
Davis said that though the memories of the Val-
halla recovery can still evoke powerful reactions, they
haven't stopped him from pursuing his passion-
caving. "They're just memories I live with," he said.

Sirens Driving Music: Man TherapyTM for First Respond-
ers (https://mantherapy.org/pdf/First-Responder-
White-Paper-July-2016.pdf) stressed the importance
of targeting the first responder community about
mental health education-using unconventional hu-
mor to draw them in. Given that the first responders
at highest risk for suicidal behaviors tend to be white
males of working age, "Man Therapy" targets those
individuals and challenges them to start talking can-
didly about mental health. How serious is this issue?
Very, according to the foundation's 2016 report. A
2015 Journal of Emergency Medical Services article that
surveyed 4,022 EMS professionals from all 50 states
revealed that 86% experienced what the authors call
"critical stress" (acute or cumulative stress from the
job), 37% had contemplated suicide, and 6.6% had at-
tempted suicide.
So while humor may work well to set us at ease
during stressful rescues or tease us into chatting
about our mental health, it's no joking matter that we
need to come up with a better way to help rescuers
deal with the darker side of their lifesaving work.
Untrained recreational cavers are often drafted to help in cave rescues. It's important for them to receive follow-up calls after traumatic rescues or
recoveries to ensure that they have the same post-traumatic stress resources available to them that are afforded members of organized cave rescue
teams. Photo by Michael Patton.
Decon for the Soul
Most cavers have begrudgingly accepted the
practice of decontaminating their caving gear after
each foray into the bowels of the earth SO that they
might prevent or forestall the spread of White-Nose
Syndrome (WNS). And SO it goes for cave rescuers.
If we want to keep enjoying our sport, and support
those who help us after we have a bad day under-
ground, we need to set up better post-rescue pro-
tocols to ensure that our rescuers are educated and
truly prepared to recognize and deal with PTS and
PTSD.
When it comes to combating PTS and PTSD, si-
lence is a surefire recipe for disaster. Though there
are many differing opinions on which awareness
or coping strategies are most effective, most would
agree that the first step in ANY successful program is
to get the conversation started.
While some organizations employ Critical In-
cident Stress Debrief (CISD) tactics after a traumatic
rescue or recovery, some mental health experts have
expressed concerns about the effectiveness of this

our members now understand that it is not a sign of

trauma they've witnessed. Though not perfect, this
method has been successful to date (on average, my

we get more practice than we'd like when it comes to
this type of outreach).
When it comes to finding a strategy to help
rescuers who are staring down the PTS blues, most
mental-health experts agree that one size does not fit
all. There is no such thing as a surefire method that
works for everyone, and the worst thing we can do
is nothing.
Closing the Loop
Back in pre-9/11 America, most of us thought of
PTSD as being something that only combat veterans
dealt with. But as horrific as the events were on that
fateful September day, they threw first responders
into the national spotlight. Consequently, this led to
them being examined under the microscope when
they struggled with 9/11's aftermath. For the first
time, we realized that soldiers and saviors were simi-
larly affected by the tragedies they faced.
But there's a stark contrast in the thought pro-
cesses and methods of soldiers versus those of the
saviors. As any combat veteran will tell you, the mili-

A Critical Component of Your Vertical System for Ensuring
W
hat is this guide and why is it necessary?
People that recreate, volunteer, or work in
a high-angle environment frequently have
little training in the nuances of carabiner form and
function because instructors perceive this informa-
tion as obvious or of little value. This has led to a pop-
ulation of recreational and professional carabiner us-
ers that know enough about carabiners to be safe on
rope, but often do not get the most out of the equip-
ment they use and own. In caving, this means that
suboptimal use of carabiners is common, sometimes
leading to accidents below ground. These accidents
are preventable with minimal training. Therefore,
the intent of this article is to help users get the most
out of their equipment, thus preventing accidents
from occurring in the first place. Presented here are
the fundamentals of carabiner selection and use. This
article can be used as a reference guide for new us-
ers and a reminder for frequent users. The intent is
to facilitate more efficient and safe rigging through
greater awareness of nuanced carabiner use.
Carabiner Anatomy
To understand the rest of this discussion, you
need to know the parts of the carabiner (Figure 1).
While the shapes, sizes, and varieties of carabiners
are many, they all have the same or similar parts.
Learn the parts of a carabiner SO you can communi-
cate with other users cogently.
Carabiner Markings and Certifications
Important information is stamped on carabiner
spines manufactured for life safety applications (Fig-
ure 2). This includes carabiner strength when loaded
along the long axis with the gate closed, when loaded
across the short axis (gate loaded), and when loaded
along the long axis and the gate is open (Figure 2,
markings in the circles). The numbers are expressed
in kilonewtons (kN), the metric unit of force. A kN
is equal to 224.81 pounds. To convert between kN
and lbs, multiply or divide by 224.8 or ~225. These
markings indicate the minimum force the carabiner
manufacturers will guarantee their product can hold
without failure in the indicated configurations. Next
to the strength markings are any national or interna-
tional certifications if the carabiner has been certified
to any (Figure 2, underlined markings). These mark-
Safety on Rope

ings indicate that the carabiner meets the minimum
requirements of a given standards agency. Com-
mon markings include those from ANSI (American
National Standards Institute), NFPA (National Fire
Protection Association), UIAA (International Climb-
ing and Mountaineering Federation), and CE (Con-
formitÃ© EuropÃ©enne). Generally, if a carabiner has a
marking from any of these groups, the carabiner is
strong enough for life safety applications. None of
these strength ratings and certifications, however,
can inform you about carabiner strength when a car-
abiner has use wear or has experienced abnormal use
or abuse.
Carabiner Shapes
Carabiner shape alters performance. Users
should ideally use the right shaped carabiner for
particular functions. Figure 3 shows the four most
common carabiner shapes, and Table 1 explains their
strengths and weaknesses.
Generally, the size of the basket, or top bar,
controls how many items can be clipped in to the
carabiner. The wider the top bar, the more items
can be clipped in. Similarly, the shape of the top bar
controls how well items stay in place. Rounded top
bars like on HMS or Oval carabiners keep materials
more or less centered on the carabiner basket, and
not along the carabiner spine, which causes lever-
age of the top bar relative to the carabiner spine. D
and Offset D-shaped carabiners have top bars that
facilitate items slipping down the basket next to the
spine. This variation in carabiner performance based
on shape means that some carabiners are compatible
with some items and not others. A more thorough
discussion of this topic is in the next section, Concept
of Compatibility.
There are many other carabiner shapes-some
specifically designed for one function or another.
Some carabiners have a twist, SO are three dimen-
sional. Each of these carabiners is a specialty model
designed for specific functions. These unique cara-
biner shapes and designs are not explored here be-
cause there is not enough space to cover the many
variations.

ibility of racks with some carabiners
has caused accidents, such as the May
2015 incident in Kentucky reported in
this issue. This has prompted some to
advocate the use of screw links to con-

while the concept of compatibility is
poorly known, it is of vital importance
to rope users, because incompatibility

4. Carabiners are much stronger with closed gates.
After rigging, double check to make sure nothing caught
and kept the carabiner open (such as webbing).
5. Prevent gates from opening during use by
locking carabiners (if possible) or facing the carabin-
er gate away from any object that could compress the
gate. Face gates away from rock walls, the ground,
limbs, or any other object.
6. When locking screw gate carabiners, screw
them shut, then back them off a quarter turn SO they
are not impossible to unscrew when loaded. If, after
loading, a screw gate carabiner is hard or impossible
to unlock, load it again, and unscrew it a little. The
deformation caused during loading can often make it
difficult to unlock if the locking mechanism tightens
when the carabiner is deformed. If a screw gate cara-
biner is impossible to open even when loaded, using
a piece of webbing as a strap wrench may unlock the
carabiner in a pinch.
7. To keep screw-gates locked during use, ori-
ent the screw gate down SO gravity screws the lock-
ing mechanism down as the carabiner shakes when
used.
8. Generally, do not overload your carabiners.
Some people use their carabiners to pull down trees,
haul cars, lift heavy loads, and SO on. While carabin-
ers will hold (usually), they were designed to hold
only one or two person loads. So avoid overloading
carabiners if possible.
9. Avoid dropping carabiners. The available data
on dropping carabiners indicates that there is little
to no strength reduction when dropping carabiners
even long distances, though carabiners can sustain
damage to the frame, gate, and locking It
is good practice not to throw carabiners around or
drop them. However, if one falls a short distance, feel
free to use it. If one falls tens or hundreds of feet onto
a hard surface, then it should probably be retired on
principle even if no significant observable damage
occurred.
10. Avoid hardware-to-hardware connections.
When two pieces of hardware are connected, they
can twist and apply torque to carabiner gates (Figure
4e,f). Obviously, it is common practice to clip hard-
ware to hardware, particularly in caving, because
we connect our ascenders and rappel devices to our
harnesses with carabiners or screwlinks. Therefore,
hardware-to-hardware connections are not horrible,
just suboptimal, because there are greater opportu-
nities for accidental incorrect use. When connecting
hardware to hardware it is good to double check to
make sure the components are in the correct orienta-
tions (that is not gate loaded or torqueing the gates)
prior to loading, or use screwlinks, which do not
have gate loading problems. This is why many cav-
ers permanently attach their rappel device to their
harness with screwlinks, because accidents have OC-
curred when carabiner gates were incorrectly loaded
or hardware was not correctly connected to harnesses
before use. 1,3 The best orientation for a locking carabi-
ner to connect a rappel device is with the gate facing
the rappeller (so that it will not open by compression
against a sharp lip) and with the gate facing down (to
keep the gate locked).
Parting Thoughts
Being an intelligent carabiner user is the best
way to ensure your safety. No matter what you buy,
it is how you use it that keeps you safe. While it is
important to know the parts of a carabiner, and what
all the markings on them mean, it is more important
to understand the strengths and weaknesses of dif-
ferent carabiner shapes, and what they are compat-
ible with. Knowing these details will enable you to
buy the most appropriate carabiner(s) or choose the
right carabiner for the job from your existing gear. I
encourage everyone to study vertical caving gear use
and techniques, because improved equipment use
may someday prevent injury to yourself or another
caver, thus making a rescue unnecessary.

open-water diving instructors, to stay out of flooded
caves, and these became a feature at the entrance to
the most popular caves in Florida and, eventually,
to many popular caves overseas. A system of route-
marking evolved to reduce navigational confusion,
aided by the introduction of the Wilson Line Arrow,
invented by lifelong NSS member Forrest Wilson.

common in cave diving, something I doubt the CDS
founders would quite have imagined. Thousands of
cave divers frequent the most popular caves, train-
ing is widely available and is largely standardized
between agencies. Gases once considered exotic are
now widely available, reels and other cave diving
gear is better made than ever, and is widely available.
Cave diving travel is more accessible than ever be-
fore, allowing U.S. cave divers to visit overseas caves
and international cave divers to visit U.S. caves. A
look back through recent issues of the CDS magazine
Underwater Speleology finds articles on cave diving in
Mexico, Canada, China, and other far-flung destina-
tions.
Meanwhile, conditions in Florida caves have
significantly deteriorated since the 1970s. Visibility is
substantially reduced in many caves due to heavier
agricultural use on the surface. Despite this, and de-
spite the growth in diver certifications, the growth
in more advanced diving, the growth in number of
international visitors, the increase in availability of
cave diving equipment and the exponential growth
in cave diving videos on the internet, despite all
this, the average number of fatalities each year is at
a record low. If we are to reduce this number further
then two things are certain; first, any improvements
from here on are going to be incremental (and virtu-
ally immeasurable), and, second, to have any effect
whatsoever things are going to have to continue to
change.

increased by one year. Over the same period they
found every four years the average age of diving
fatalities increased by two years. Indeed, looking at
the claims rates of insured divers it was clear that the
risk of death (per 10,000 member-years) increased
substantially with age. Perhaps this is an opportunity
for the CDS to take a leadership role, in promoting
health for cave diving.
Technology will no doubt continue to advance.
For example, in 2014 the first dive computer ap-
peared with in-built Near Field Communication
(NFC) technology. NFC allows the transfer of infor-
mation between a reader and a chip embedded in a
card, such as when you swipe a key-card to open the
door to your hotel room. It was predicted at the time
that the most popular flooded caves might embed
maps inside line arrows, thus allowing cave divers
to place their dive computers over an arrow and see
a map on the screen pin-pointing exactly where they
are located. This is one example of how the existing
system of route-marking and navigation might yet
be improved even further.
In terms of decompression stress, there have been
remarkable discoveries in decompression research in
recent years. However, big ships move slowly, and
science is a big ship indeed SO while recent results in
decompression science offer promise, it may be some
time before practical advances are supported, for ex-

ample in recommending certain foods to augment
decompression, specific pre-dive exercise patterns,
environmental preconditioning and/or inert gas op-
timization. Meanwhile, cave divers continue forging
ahead, making dives that would have sounded im-
possible not that long ago. Perhaps that is an area
the NSS-CDS could excel at? Decompression for cave
diving. The NSS-CDS led the way when rebreather
technology first gained popularity in US cave diving,
by producing rebreather cave diving materials. The
same is true for side-mounting, (where divers wear
scuba tanks on the side rather than on the back).
These are two good examples of the CDS leading the
way in injury prevention, through training.
In closing, I would like to congratulate the NSS
for producing 50 years of American Caving Accidents
(ACA). There is little point to monitoring injuries and
near-misses in an operational context such as caving
and cave-diving unless that surveillance leads to re-
duction in risk. Cave diving instructors look to ACA
for examples to share with their students, and cases
are often discussed between divers in online forums.
Over half a century, the NSS has amassed a dataset
rich in potential to continue assisting the develop-
ment of injury prevention interventions. What they
might be, and how the CDS might implement them,
remain to be seen (over the next 50 years).

facts of the accident and rescue
attempt.
Floyd, 37, had been a suc-
cessful cave explorer for many
years. In 1910 he discovered
Donkey Cave on his family farm.
This 800-foot-long trunk passage
had a crawlway near its termi-
nal breakdown that led to some
vertical shafts. He explored Salts
Cave with others. He discovered
Crystal Cave in 1918 on the farm.
It revealed fantastic gypsum dis-

Floyd Collins contracted with three farmers
while he hunted for the cave.
Starting around January 20,
1925, Floyd scoured the land-
scape and selected a sandstone
overhang at the head of a reen-
trant valley as a likely place for
an entrance. He saw that the back
wall of the overhang bottomed
at the contact of the Girkin lime-
stone, SO digging there might
open a passage into a cave below.
He spent two weeks excavating,
first finding a small grand piano-
shaped room three feet high. He
dug along the line of least resis-
tance between breakdown blocks,
hauling the soil out in burlap
bags. His tunnel led to another
small void. This cavity, the size
of the interior of a small pup tent
formed a turnaround room, and
formed an acute angle that dou-
bled back and down. He followed
the easy way, down a chute that
was barely man-size, descending
a
15Â° angle. At the bottom, he found a solid rock

rope and kerosene lantern ahead of him. The crawl
opened on the lip of a pit. Floyd rigged the rope as a
hand line and lowered himself to stand in the bottom
of a deep pit. He said there were several leads out,
but his lamp flickered. He'd forgotten to fill the lamp,
but no big deal, he headed back the 150-foot route
toward the entrance.
A few feet from the pit he came to where the blast
had loosened the rocks. He rolled onto his back and
pushed the lantern ahead of him vigorously-
tipped over and went out. He was in the dark, but
did not panic-he'd once spent 18 hours in the dark
in Crystal Cave groping his way out by feel alone.
He kicked with his left foot, causing a suspend-
ed rock to drop, pinning his left ankle in a V-shaped
crevice. He wiggled and pushed, but the left leg
became even more trapped. Other rocks fell, bury-
ing his feet and lower torso. Now he panicked! He
clawed with his hands for purchase until he felt pain.
Too bad he hadn't told farmer Bee Doyel exactly
when he'd be back.
It rained that Friday night and Saturday. Doyle
was used to Floyd's odd hours, SO he finally set out
early Sunday morning with partner Ed Estes and his
son, Jewell. At the entrance to Sand Cave they found
Floyd's coat hanging on a wall nubbin. His rifle was
there. Jewell Estes, the kid, was sent into the hole to
find Floyd. Jewel's yells summoned a faint cry from
Floyd. "I'm trapped Bring some tools. get my
brothers." Doyel and Ed went to the Collins farm and
alerted his father Lee and brother Marshall. One of
the most bizarre rescue attempts began.
Several facts should be noted. The site where
Floyd was trapped could be reached by only very
small men-only four or five could reach him. Sec-
ond, those few had to go down the chute head first to
reach Floyd. Feet first, they'd step on his face! Third,
only two were cavers - Floyd's brother Homer, and
Floyd's friend Johnnie Gerald had caved a few times
with Floyd. Skeets Miller, the young reporter from
the Louisville Courier-Journal had never been in any
cave.
It was hours before Homer brought food and
water to Floyd. Hypothermia was already in progress
and water dripped on Floyd's face. Well-meaning
volunteers took food into the cave, but were quickly
terrified by the tight quarters, SO they stashed the
food in the first room-then they lied about feeding
Floyd.
Skeets Miller encountered Homer outside the
cave early in the morning. The reporter quizzed the
exhausted Homer, who urged Miller to find out the
answers himself. Miller plunged in Sand Cave with
a borrowed flashlight, slid headfirst down the chute,
and landed on Floyd's face.
The problem was that working upside down

speed fire attack capability and the "fill the basement
with water" old ways. Cave rescue capability prof-
ited by the lessons, but too slowly to save all cavers
from death even today.
Innovations and specialties, such as combin-
ing teams and techniques, spread: EMS, high-angle,
heavy lift, and underwater teams appeared. Forest
firefighting is a full-time industry. Equipment, from
expensive aerial ladders to foam suppression to tank-
er aircraft ran up the cost along with the capability.
Regular training and incident commanders short-
ened response times and improved communications
and techniques. Cross-training of modern search and
rescue skills is widespread today. Today's cave res-
cue teams are located, trained, and on call in major
U.S. cave areas. Caver personal safety is a part of ev-
ery beginning caver's ongoing orientation. While the
lessons of the Floyd Collins entrapment are applied
daily, modern rescue is taught by the combination
of all forms of emergency, disaster, catastrophe, and
preparedness safety training.
What strategic principles should all cave rescu-
ers should keep in mind? Here are a few:
1. Time is not your friend. The longer the time
between call and adequate response, the more the
risk and bad consequences escalate. Callout commu-
nications are vital, as are jurisdictional agreements.
2. Teams that train together rescue better. A
good team knows the thinking and actions of other
members. Cooperation and following the team lead-
er is a given in most teams today. In the Floyd Col-
lins accident, there were primadonnas, quarrelers,
and lone wolves. Loud-mouth know-it-alls took over
from the few competent individuals.
3. Promptly locate cavers familiar with the res-
cue cave. They already know things about the cave in
question that will take you time to learn. Call out in-
formed cavers immediately after the response team.
4. Always consider alternatives. The best plans
may need to be changed when the unanticipated hap-
pens. It is better to call out more trained teams than
risk wearing out the first responders. Hypothermia
should be prevented even in routine cave rescues, SO
extra warmth provision is prudent preparation.
5. Efficiency in cave rescue is a prudent con-
servation of energy. Manage human and supply re-
sources wisely for best results. Plan for backups and
second and third alternatives. Flooded cavers? The
flood usually recedes quickly.
These are not just my ideas. They are lessons
learned from Cave Research Foundation (CRF) prac-
tice rescues and experiences of cave-rescue teams.
I'm sure that seasoned cave-rescue workers will have
their own list of strategic and tactical imperatives.
CRF has organized dozens of caving expeditions an-
nually, with 3 to 20 parties per expedition, over a 60-
year period. It has an enviable safety record, if not a

perfect one. Experienced cavers on hand is one factor
in safe caving, and another is continuous safety in-
struction to new cavers.
As part of the research for the book Trapped!, my
son Tom Brucker (NSS 24892 RL, LB, FE) was part
of a team that made six trips into Sand Cave to ex-
plore, survey, photograph, and thoroughly examine
it. He has more than 50 years of experience caving
in Mammoth Cave, and has his own observations on
the Floyd Collins saga:
"Hindsight is 20/20. To a modern caver, Floyd's
early tomb was spacious by crawlway standards.
The space above the rock tube had enough room
for a 6-foot-tall caver to turn around, and was wide
enough for two friendly cavers to work. Once we
learned the route, and the trick to passing over and
around a large breakdown block, we could travel the
length of Sand Cave in 15 minutes or less.
"As might be imagined, Floyd's comfort lev-
el and strength would have been improved by the
steady delivery of hot water bottles or sacks of heat-
ed gravel, delivered by modern cavers. What more
might have been done makes for interesting specu-
lation because, in the science of cave rescue, no two
incidents are ever the same.
"Had an experienced cave rescue team existed
in 1925, they might have gathered above Sand Cave
on day four. Evaluation of safety risks presented by
Sand Cave, and of Floyd himself, might have taken all
of one hour. Sand Cave was stable, fairly dry, and the
tunneled crawlway actually occupied spaces in lime-
stone breakdown. The cave exhaled 54Â°F air (typical
for higher entrances in winter.) Floyd was conscious
and was able to describe the captive rock.
"What is not clear today is whether more rock
could have been removed beside and below Floyd to
improve access below his knees. Miller describes ly-
ing on top of Floyd while trying to position a screw
jack. Modern cavers are quite familiar with the odd
contortions needed to lever breakdown apart. Would

pulled apart, perhaps losing a limb to the entrapping
rock. Did the victim's "idea" stymie the rescue team?
Would the application of a bottle of ether have qui-

"NCRC training teaches that the 'patient advo-
cate' has a responsibility to feed back information to
the rescue team. Homer Collins was just such an ad-
vocate. It would be highly unusual for a family mem-
ber to be a rescue participant, but in this case, did the
relationship hinder Floyd's last chance for rescue?
"Digging and drilling rescue shafts are not cur-
rently recognized cave rescue methods (yet they are
known in mine rescues; for example, the 33 Chilean
miners rescued after 40 days from 2,300 feet down by
drilling a 28-inch shaft in 2010.) Once Sand Cave was

********** Cave Better, Cave Safer: Join the NSS
T
lhe book you are holding is a review of 50 years'
of work by NSS members to unravel and ana-
lyze the "why" of cave accidents in the hope of
making caving safer for all. It is the ultimate source
of data on caving safety and underground search
and rescue.
By examining all manner of caving accidents
that have occurred over the past half-century, the ed-
itors and writers present lessons learned in the hope
that readers will benefit from the mistakes made by
others. Should you be involved in a caving accident,
we hope that the knowledge you gained by reading
this book will help to inform your decision-making
and enable you to more knowledgeably address the
situation.
There is no guarantee that even the safest,
most careful caver will not have an accident. That is
why many cavers dedicate themselves to the man-
tra, "Cavers Rescue Cavers." Through the National
Cave Rescue Commission (NCRC, http://www.ncrc.
info/), cavers learn what is necessary to become first
responders, and first responders learn what is nec-
essary to be cave rescuers. As they advance their
knowledge, many volunteer their time to train oth-
ers at NCRC events. You will find gems of wisdom

from these experts sprinkled throughout this book.
We guarantee that you will re-read many sections as
you become more deeply involved in caving.
As a member of the NSS, or through the pur-
chase of this book, you support those who undertook
this comprehensive effort to analyze cave accidents.
If you are in a jam underground, you are far better
off having rescue-trained cavers coming to your aid
than well-intentioned responders who may never
have been underground and must first learn to cope
with a new and unfamiliar environment. The cave
is better off, too, for having experienced and trained
cavers performing a rescue or evacuation. Caves are
fragile, and cavers know and respect all cave resourc-
es as they work to find or extract a patient as quickly
and safely as possible.
If you are an NSS member, you are likely famil-
iar with the goals of the NSS and the NCRC. If you
are not an NSS member, then you may not be aware
of the many reasons for you to join the United States'
premier caving organization:
First, the NSS gives caving national clout. Lo-
cal involvement is important. If you don't care about

light turning on in his chest pocket; a locking cara-
biner failed when it was cross-loaded; and another
cross-loaded carabiner, which was found to also be
unlocked, caused a near miss. Cavers in Montana
dropped a gear bag that was not retrievable, SO they
improvised rigging their final rappel on a through
trip. A new rope was severely abraded for unknown
reasons, and two separate caving parties had their
ropes vandalized at cave entrances.
Exhaustion - Three incidents are attributed to ex-
haustion, with the cavers needing outside assistance
or support from their team members. The caver in
the Cemetery Pit incident became exhausted due to
poor ascending technique, SO exhaustion is listed as
a secondary cause.
Flooding - Flooding caused the temporary entrap-
ment of three separate groups. The cavers in the Bin-
kley Cave System incident spent more than 24 hours
waiting for the water to recede. Flooding may have
been the initial trigger in the Cascade Cave incident,
but since most of the group made it out safely, the
two cavers who stayed behind became stranded as
the water levels continued to rise.
Hypothermia - Hypothermia is often a secondary
outcome in caving incidents, often resulting from a
caver being stuck, injured, or stranded in a cave. It is
especially dangerous not only because of the physi-
ological aspects, but because it impairs judgment,
which can lead to mistakes and other accidents. No
incidents are listed with hypothermia as the prima-
ry factor, but the patient in the Ellisons Cave inci-
dent was dangerously hypothermic when rescuers
reached him.
Illness/Medical Issue - There are three incidents of
persons becoming ill or having a medical emergency
during caving trips. Two of the patients were able to
walk out of the cave, the third was rescued from an
entrance pit. Three cave-diving fatalities are attribut-
ed to medical issues, including a diver who became
lost underwater, but found an unfamiliar entrance,
only to die of a heart attack while trying to find his
way out of the jungle.
Lost - A group of cavers attempting a pull-down
through trip in West Virginia could not find their way
through the system and needed rescuing. Less than a
month later, three college students became lost while
caving in Arkansas; they too had to sit and wait for
rescue.
Lost Control on Rappel-T incident-type category
was added in 2011 to cover incidents of persons los-
ing control while on rappel. In previous issues, these
incidents were listed under Caver Falls or Difficulty
on Rope. While most out-of-control rappels also re-
sult in a caver fall, the contributing factor or cause is
very different than those typical for caver falls. The
only reported incident in this category is from Little
Bitterroot Canyon Ice Cave.
Rockfall - Three incidents from rockfall are reported
in this issue. In two of the incidents, the moving rock
was due to cavers disturbing the rock as they moved
through the cave. Injuries ranged from bruises and
lacerations to a crushed foot and ankle.
Stuck - The only report of a stuck caver involved a
youth on a guided tour at Raccoon Mountain Cav-
erns.
Trapped or Stranded - This category describes in-
cidents in which the caver or cavers are prevented
from exiting the cave. There are eight incidents re-
ported of this type. Reasons include not being able
to cross back over a muddy ledge, waiting out high
water levels, two incidents of not having the proper
gear to ascend after rappelling or descending a rope
hand-over-hand, not being able to get back through
a tight, awkward bend in a crawlway, being trapped
by an ice fall, running out of light, and not being able
to exit due to rockfall blocking a passage.
Other - This catch-all category includes incidents
that don't quite fit in other categories. Examples in
this issue include persons overdue from a cave trip,
muscle injuries, two fatalities from an ice cave col-
lapse, and two deaths from unknown causes.
Cave Diving Accidents and Incidents - Five cave-
diving incidents from 2015 and five from 2016 were
reported. All of the incidents involved fatalities.

2015 CAVING ACCIDENTS AND INCIDENTS


********** 8 January 2015
unspecified marble quarry, California
illness, aid, no injury
Long-time caver Ralph Squire has been work-
ing on cave digs in a marble quarry for more than 40
years. The entrance area is a pit that is climbed with
a ladder. On 8 January, Squire's family found him
in the pit, conscious, but hypothermic and unable to
get out on his own. Local rescue crews packaged him
and transported him to a hospital. The cause of his
medical event is unknown.
1. Roger Mortimer, e-mail communication, 6 March
Comments: One of the first rules of safe caving
is to never cave alone. If a caver becomes sick or in-
jured, it is helpful to have someone who can stay with
the patient while others go for help. Even minor mis-
haps while caving solo can have dire consequences.


********** 14 February 2015
Carroll Cave, Missouri
difficulty on rope/ladder, no injury, no aid
Dr. David Ashley, professor of biology at Mis-
souri Western State University, teaches a Cave Biol-
ogy class, which includes trips to a variety of caves
around Missouri to collect biological data and ana-
lyze the data as a class project. A trip to Carroll Cave
on 14 February consisted of Dr. Ashley, 10 students,
two experienced cavers (one an EMT), and trip lead-
er Bill Gee.
The entrance to Carroll Cave that the group
used is a man-made shaft 120-feet deep and about 30
inches in diameter. The shaft has a ladder bolted to
the wall with a stainless-steel cable running down it.
Cavers usually hang a rope in the shaft SO that they
enter by rappelling and exit by climbing the ladder
while attached to the rope with a harness and Croll.
A building over the shaft contains a life-rated winch
that can be used to haul a patient up the shaft. The
winch is hand-cranked with a 6:1 mechanical advan-
tage and has an automatic brake. Normal exit pro-
cedure is for the trip leader to climb the ladder first,
and then wait at the top to help inexperienced people
get safely off the rope and out of the shaft.
The caving trip and biological work was ac-
complished without incident in about seven hours.
Gee climbed the ladder first. After he got off rope,
the students clipped in and started climbing, assist-
ed by the experienced cavers at the bottom. As soon
as one person climbed a few feet, the next person
clipped in and started up. A female student (30) was
the fifth person to start. About halfway up the lad-
der, she complained of claustrophobia and difficulty
climbing. A few steps later, she passed out, her Croll
preventing a fall. Unfortunately, the EMT-caver was
at the bottom of the climb and could not reach her
to perform an assessment because at least one other
student was on rope below her. The people above her
rapidly completed their climb and were assisted off
rope by Gee, who then lowered the winch hook into
the shaft. Another student attached the hook to the
woman's seat harness. Gee and another person then
cranked the winch to bring her to the top. Gee had
to climb into the shaft briefly to detach the student's
Croll from the rope SO she could be raised completely
out of the shaft and into the building above it. By this
time, she was alert enough to hang onto the winch
cable while the operation was completed. She rested
in the building for a few minutes and then exited by
her own power to change her clothes. The remain-
ing students finished the ascent without any further
problems. The entire incident lasted about 15 min-
utes.
1. Bill Gee, Incident Report, 17 February 2015.
2. Bill Gee, e-mail communication, 17 December
2015.
Comments: The Carroll Cave Conservancy
equipped the entrance shaft with the winch for an
emergency such as this, and this group equipped
each caver with a harness and safety to prevent a
fall. While they should not be used to belay or catch
a fall (which would be fall protection), toothed as-
cenders can be safely used as progress capture or fall
prevention as in this incident. Cavers should weigh
the time-saving benefits of certain techniques against
the safety issues they may introduce. In this cave en-
trance, it saves time to have everyone climb at once,
but doing SO could lead to patient access issues in
case of a medical incident or gear problem.

from Jewel Cave, South Dakota, on 28 May 2013.


********** 1 April 2015
Decorah Ice Cave, Iowa
caver fall, injury and aid
In the 1980s, unstable rocks in the ceiling of Dec-
orah Ice Cave prompted the Iowa State Parks Depart-
ment to install a gate, leaving only the first 50 feet
accessible to the public. On 1 April, a woman slipped
on the ice at the entrance and slid down further into
the cave, breaking an ankle. Local police, fire, rescue,
and ambulance crews responded to the scene and
helped the woman out. She was taken by ambulance
to a hospital.

3. James Hedges and George Knudson, "The Ice
Cave at Decorah, Iowa." The Annals of Iowa 43 (1975),
pages 113-131.
Comments: In ice caves, it is often necessary
to add additional ice traction to prevent slips. Some
ways that cavers can enhance traction include cram-
pons, elastic slip-on devices such as MICROspikesÂ®,
or 1/4-inch hex screws screwed into their boot tread.


********** 5 April 2015
unspecified cave, New Mexico
caver fall, injury, no aid
A biology/caver team (Diana Northup, Debbie
Buecher, Bob Buecher, and Eric Weaver) and three
additional cavers entered an unspecified lava tube
in El Malpais National Monument near Grants. The
cavers were on the trip to take photographs for white-
nose-syndrome research. One of the cavers, Kenneth
Ingham (52), wore an internal-frame pack loaded
with photographic equipment; he uses this pack be-
cause the frame can be used as a light stand. On his
way into the cave, he moved along a ledge toward a
step down when his pack caught a low spot, knock-
ing him forward. He fell about 6 feet but landed on
his feet, absorbing most of the shock and energy in
his legs. He landed on the only flat rock in the area.
The group completed the trip but after exiting, Ing-
ham went to a doctor. The x-rays revealed no broken
bones, but Ingham reports that he limped for several
weeks after the trip.
1. Kenneth Ingham, personal communication, 13 July
2015.
Comments: Large packs, especially those that
protrude above the helmet, can catch on cave ceilings,
causing accidents and damage to speleothems. While
pack size should usually be kept to a minimum, cer-
tain underground activities will always require large
packs with lots of equipment. When undertaking
these activities, extra care should be taken to man-
age the heightened safety and resource risks. Ingham
was fortunate to have made such a safe landing. Even
a 6-foot fall onto breakdown rocks could cause griev-
ous injury, or even death.


********** 17 April 2015
Dry Creek Falls Cave, Tennessee
difficulty on rope, no injury, no aid
Megan Carden (21), Heath Rowland, Chris Hig-
gins, and Clinton Elmore entered Dry Creek Falls
Cave, a very wet multi-drop cave. Their intention
was to drop the first three pits and then climb out.
Elmore wore a full 3-mm wetsuit and the others
wore polypropylene for warmth. The group rigged

drop, a 78-foot pit only 30 feet from the base of the
previous drop, using a "questionable bolt" backed
up by the rope from the previous drop, which was
tensioned to distribute the load. Water was flowing
into the pit from the top, but the cavers did not im-
mediately know there was another waterfall entering
the pit about 15 feet below the top.
Elmore descended through the waterfall and

Neffs Cave, Utah
difficulty on rope, no injury, no aid
Caleb Ferbrache (30) led a group of cavers on a
trip to the bottom of Neffs Cave near Salt Lake City.
Neffs is vertically rigorous with nine drops requiring
690 feet of ropework to reach the bottom of the 1,163-
foot-deep cave. Ferbrache was aware that there was a
risk of his 6-inch-long beard being pulled into his de-
scending device. He had intended to tie up his beard
and secure it, but after completing the long, steep,
uphill hike to the cave, he realized he had left his hair
ties in his car. He decided to complete the trip to the
bottom of the cave by remaining aware and cautious
of the long hair on his face while rappelling.
He completed several rappels, but when he was
about 100 feet down the 200-foot-deep Great Pit, his
beard was pulled into his Petzl Stop descender. He
quickly noticed what had happened, stopped him-
self, and tied off his descender. The beard was quite
deep in the descender, but there was still about an
inch that was free. His immediate reaction was to
rip his beard out of the device. He used his hands
to break hairs when possible, and other times had to
pluck the hair from his face. It was a painful process,
but he was able to free himself in a couple of minutes.
Once he reached the bottom of the pit, he found a
scarf in his pack, which he wore around his face for
the rest of the trip. The team successfully made it to
the bottom of the cave and then exited without any
further complications. Ferbrache says he now wears
a BuffÂ® scarf as a hood, as it keeps his beard pressed
close against his neck with minimal discomfort.
1. Caleb Ferbrache, Incident Report, 7 November
2016.
Comments: Ferbrache was wearing his ascend-
ing gear while on rappel, SO if he had failed on his first
attempts to rip the beard out, he would have quickly
been able to perform a changeover, completely un-
weighting the descender.

Neffs Cave, Utah
equipment problem, no injury, no aid
Nick Steele (26) and three other Utah cavers par-
ticipated in a trip to the bottom of Neffs Cave. The
1,163-foot-deep cave has a series of numerous ver-
tical pitches that requires a considerable amount of
rigging. The cave had been recently rigged by mem-
bers of the Salt Lake Grotto, SO this group was not
rigging or derigging as they went. As the cavers were
ascending back to the entrance, Steele was the sec-
ond climber on a 100-foot pitch. As he ascended to a
lip he could see the rig point above him and realized
the carabiner between the webbing anchor and the
rope was cross loaded. He cautiously made his way
over the lip and ascended a few more feet to where
he could safely get off rope. As he corrected the rig-
ging for the next caver, he realized that the carabiner
was also unlocked.
The first caver who had gone up the rope had
not taken the slack out of the rigging when he got off
rope. He had also left to start the next climb before
seeing Steele load the system.
1. Nicholas Steele, Incident Report, 14 January 2016.
Comments: "Off rope" doesn't just mean off
rope. When we call "off rope" at the top of a pitch,
what we are really saying is, "I'm off the rope and
out of the fall zone. I have checked all the rigging
and have made sure that everything is safe, includ-
ing carabiner loading and locking. I have checked
that the rope is on all rope pads, off of sharp edges,
and hanging free from snags and ledges. The rope
is safe and ready for you to ascend." We must do a
quick survey of all of these conditions before calling
"off rope." Often, ropes get pulled off of rope pads
and carabiners rotate when a caver is getting off rope
at the top of a pitch. In this case, a quick look back
would have caught the cross-loaded carabiner (likely
rotated after unweighting), and would have been
simple to remedy. While fixing the carabiner orienta-
tion, the unlocked gate would likely have been dis-
covered and fixed as well. In his report, Steele men-
tions, "Because the cave was pre-rigged, I think our
normal checks and normal way of thinking about
rigging was altered a bit, which led us to be less cau-
tious."


********** 19 June 2015
Jewel Cave, South Dakota
caver fall, injury, no aid
On 19 June, five cavers entered Jewel Cave for a
four-day camp trip in the newly established Western
Camp. On the way to camp, the cavers approached
an area known as the VACC (Victory After Con-
tinuous Contortions). The first three cavers entered
the VACC, with Ian Chechet (29) going fourth. As
Chechet approached the VACC, he began to climb
up and over a boulder that cavers have been climb-
ing over since 1982. He explains, "As I began to ma-
neuver around the top of this rock (to the left), I put
my hand on it to pull myself up. I maintained three
points of contact while making this move. As I gen-
tly pulled against the rock, it started to shift, slowly
at first. I tried to move out of the way, but it began
moving faster and faster towards me. The only op-
tion was to let go of the rock to avoid being crushed.
As I let go, I began falling backwards and eventually
fell towards the floor headfirst."
The rock rolled about 5 feet before becom-
ing wedged. Chechet fell about 10 feet, then rolled
downslope through a hole in the floor. He called for
his teammates who quickly returned and assisted in
conducting a medical assessment. He suffered nu-
merous cuts and contusions to his legs, back, and
elbows. The team advised him to sit and relax and al-
low the adrenalin to wear off to see if he noticed any
other pain. After cleaning and dressing some of his
wounds, Chechet thought he felt all right, but after a
group discussion, the team decided to abort the trip.
Chechet exited the cave unassisted but experienced
pain in his left heel and shin on the way out.
1. Ian Chechet, Trip Report, 19 June 2015.
Comments: Unfortunately, rocks that have been
stable and part of a trade route for many years can
suddenly decide to move. Chechet's reflexes prob-
ably prevented greater injury. While likely a difficult
decision for cavers that had planned for weeks and
traveled hundreds of miles, it was prudent to abort
the trip. A remote underground camp is not always
the best place to assess the extent of and monitor an
injury. Returning to the surface affords opportunities
to recover in comfortable and sanitary conditions,
along with access to advanced medical care should it
become necessary.

other (bear spray deployed), no injury,
no aid
During a public tour, a visitor accidentally dis-
charged bear spray in the cave. The visitor had recent-
ly been hiking in Yellowstone National Park and still
had his bear spray in its holster attached to his day
pack. The visitor was asked by the ranger tour guide
to wear his pack on his front to avoid inadvertently
hitting low-hanging formations. Wearing his pack on
the front placed his pack straps and the bear spray on
his back. As the visitor ducked under a low spot near
a large formation known as The Heart, the bear spray
bumped the ceiling, causing it to discharge. Most of
the spray was contained by the holster and the visi-
tor's shirt, but the visitor's nephew, who was behind
him, received some spray in his face. Other members
of the visitor's family who were in the back of the
tour group found it difficult to breathe as they then
passed through the area.
When the group assembled at the next stop on
the tour, the ranger leading the group was informed
of the incident. The ranger led her group out of the
cave and notified other rangers of the accidental
spray. Other tour groups already in the cave were
evacuated and tours were canceled for the rest of the
day. Visitors affected by the closure were either re-
scheduled or offered a refund.
All doors to the cave were opened for the next
several hours to allow the cave to air out. The con-
crete tour trail and handrails in the affected area were
wiped down with isopropyl alcohol, as suggested by
the bear-spray manufacturer. Tours resumed the fol-
lowing morning.
Visitors in the cave at the time of the incident
reported some temporary itching and burning sensa-
tions in the throat but no lasting effects.

Comments: Inspection of the bear spray re-
vealed that the safety device on the can was missing,
unbeknownst to the visitor. Bear spray is considered
a weapon and is therefore not allowed on cave tours.
The visitor did not know this, and the ranger did not
notice the bear spray on the visitor's pack.

Stephens Gap Cave, Alabama
stranded, aid, no injury
Rob Cordle (34) and a friend visited Stephens
Gap Cave without any caving gear. The cave has
two large entrances, one is a walk-in entrance and
the other requires a 143-foot rappel. While his friend
climbed atop the Pedestal formation, Cordle climbed
out along a ledge, tracking mud onto the ledge as he
proceeded. When he turned to go back, he found that
the mud made travel too difficult. He told his friend
he needed help. Luckily, a group of cavers from the
Huntsville Cave Rescue Unit happened to be arriv-
ing at the cave just then.
Michelle Edwards rappelled as close as she
could to the stranded man and threw the bottom of
her rope to him. He was able to pull her over to him
and once on the ledge, she assisted him in putting on
a harness. After attaching Cordle to her own harness,
she rappelled with him to the floor of the cave. From
there, they exited through the horizontal entrance.
1. Holliday Williams, Incident Report, 28 September

Comments: Although sometimes easier said
than done, it is good practice to think about how you
will get out of a situation before you put yourself in
it. Some cave surfaces can be easily traveled when
dry, and only become hazardous once tracked with
mud or water.

Big Four Ice Caves, Washington
2 fatalities, other (ice cave collapse)
The mile-long trail that leads to the Big Four Ice
Caves in Snohomish County, Washington, is a pop-
ular hike for thousands of visitors each year for its
scenic appeal and cool, summer temperatures. The
caves are the site of several past ice collapses, some
of which have resulted in fatalities. A U.S. Forest
Service sign near the caves states, "People have been
killed and injured in and on the ice caves-be safe,
not sorry!" but it is often ignored by visitors intent on
entering the caves.
On 6 July, when the temperature was near 80Â°F,
several people entered the cave. Eyewitnesses report
they heard a loud crack, followed by falling ice and
debris. Annalisa Santana (34) was killed in the col-
lapse and her brother, David Santana (25), was criti-

and drove 15 miles until they could get cell phone

exit the Kathy's Icebox Entrance. After eight hours of

of the cave. The only way to avoid the water in the
bottom of the canyon was to crawl along very thin
ledges on either side. While they squeezed through
this section, a cave pack was inadvertently dropped
into the water where it sank before the cavers could
retrieve it. The pack contained all of the rope, web-
bing, and carabiners needed for the vertical exit.
The cavers were wet and cold and decided they
would continue a quarter mile to Kathy's Icebox
rather than turn around. They hoped to find rope
and rigging materials along the way, left from ex-
plorations that had entered that side of the system.
When they reached Kathy's Icebox, they had col-
lected four locking carabiners, 40 feet of 6-mm corde-
lette, 30 feet of a rat-chewed 11-mm static rope, 7 feet
of seat belt webbing packstraps, and a 10-foot-long
Spectra@climbing sling to use for the 100-foot-deep
drop. Although cavers usually rig to bolts and rappel
the entire length, some sections can be downclimbed.
Gindling explains, "I first attached a carabiner to the
bolt and used the cordelette with the pack strap at-
tached to the bottom to climb down the first section
and onto an isolated pillar of rock peeling off the cliff.
I then used the sling around a breakdown rock and
attached the rat-chewed rope for the rappel off the
pillar."

ing a rescue or an incident like this one, it is good
to remember that multi-drop caves often contain an
available gear cache. To help prevent situations such
as this one, distribute essential gear among several
packs to limit the severity of the situation if one pack
is lost.

East Crater Cave, Washington
bad air, no injury, no aid
The summit craters of Mount Rainier contain the
world's largest network of volcanic steam caves. In
August 2015, an expedition was conducted to study
and explore the caves. The caves are formed in the
summit glacial ice cap by heated gases emerging from
fumaroles in the volcano crater. The research team
consisted of fourteen cavers who camped in the sum-
mit crater for six days. The team was well equipped
with gas monitors, passive respirator masks, rescue
and safety equipment, and an accompanying medi-
cal doctor. A full self-contained breathing apparatus
(SCBA) was available 3,000 feet below the summit at
a lower camp on the mountain. On the fourth day at
the summit, a team of two experienced cavers, Chris-
tian Stenner (35) and Nicholaus Vieira (34), was ex-
ploring and surveying chambers connecting to two
large entrances close to the summit. The ground was
a thin layer of mud and loose rocks slanted steeply
downward at 50 degrees. Stenner was moving down
to pick a survey station when his feet slipped out
from under him. He fell, sliding out of control down
the slope and over a lip, finally coming to a stop a
few feet from the bottom of the chamber.
Stenner explains, "My heart rate had shot up
along with my breathing. At first I thought my pulse
was elevated because I had just taken a fall and the
breathing was due to the altitude. Nick couldn't see
me. He shouted to ask if I was ok, but I couldn't an-
swer. My labored breathing had escalated to gasping
and as I looked around I saw that the ice wall of the
chamber met the floor in a pile of boulders. I realized
that my gasping was because I was in a pocket of bad
air, and as I had that realization, a slight panic set in.
I turned around to face the slope. It was steep. With
my brain and body now in oxygen deficit I hesitated;
at that moment I didn't think I had the energy or ca-
pacity to climb. Feeling like I was about to pass out,

Pond Cave, Arizona
equipment problem, no injury, no aid
Larry Zimmer, Mike Van Note, and Joel Laws
visited Pond Cave for a day of exploring and survey-
ing. Zimmer tied a rope to a nearby tree to use as a
handline for a 10-foot pit just inside the cave's en-
trance. At the end of the day, Zimmer and Van Note
decided to check one more passage as Laws headed
out. When Laws reached the bottom of the pit, he
pulled on the rope to take out any slack and was sur-
prised when the rope fell down the pit, landing at
his feet.
The pit lacked good handholds, but Laws was
able to climb out after a few attempts, taking one
end of the rope with him. On the surface, he found
a section of the rope and a carabiner still tied around
the tree. The rope had clearly been cut. There were
also fresh hatchet marks on the tree and on others in
the area. Laws rerigged the rope SO the other cavers
could climb out.

medical issue, aid, no injury
A team of four cavers visited Fort Stanton Cave
to collect samples in conjunction with Dr. Victor
Polyak's paleoclimate research. The team entered
the cave at about 1045 and made its way to the Tro-
phy Room (more than one mile from the entrance)
without incident, arriving just before 1300. The team
completed the sample collection and started out of
the cave at 1515.
Shortly after beginning the return trip, Steve
Peerman (65) felt weak and dizzy, and called for a
rest. After a brief rest, they continued out of the cave,
but Peerman found that his heart was racing and he
was very weak. He realized he would need help and
sent the two youngest cavers (Justin Peinado and
Chrissy Allen) out to summon assistance, while he
and Evelyn Townsend started slowly making their
way out of the cave.
Peerman could go only a short distance be-
fore having to rest. It took four hours to get almost
through Crystal Crawl, where other cavers met them
and helped them get to 20 Steps (0.44 miles from the
entrance), where they were met by a rescue team. The
EMTs immediately put Peerman on a heart monitor
(his resting heart rate was between 170 and 190 beats
per minute) and started an IV. They were eventually
able to bring his heart rate down to normal, and he
was able to walk out of the cave. He was transported
by ambulance to the Ruidoso Hospital Emergency
Room, and then to the Las Cruces Memorial General
Hospital, where he was examined by a cardiologist.
The diagnosis was a supraventricular tachycardia
(SVT) event. Peerman was discharged from the hos-
pital on 26 October.

other (muscle injury), injury, no aid
Tim Williams (50) was making his way up a
climb that was slippery with corrosion residue when
he slipped. He was able to push forcefully with
his left leg to stop his fall. Unfortunately, the large
amount of force necessary to stop the fall injured
the quadriceps muscle in his thigh. When a cramp-
ing feeling caused him to investigate more closely,
Williams noticed that a knot of muscle was bulging
outward from the inside of his thigh. The accident
occurred on the second day of an eight-day, nine-
person survey expedition based at Deep Seas Camp
in the Western Branch. Williams rested his leg for an
hour, compressed the injury with athletic tape, and
was able to make the 2.5-hour trip back to camp ac-
companied by his teammates.
In camp, another expedition member who is
a medical doctor examined the leg and suggested
that Williams may have torn the fascia around the
quadriceps, causing muscle tissue to herniate out-
ward through the tear (this was later confirmed to be
the correct diagnosis). By taking a rest day in camp,
medicating with ibuprofen, wrapping the injury with
athletic tape, and being careful not to take big steps
with his left leg, Williams was able to participate in
shorter survey trips away from camp throughout the
week.
To exit the cave, expedition members divided
up and carried items from Williams' pack, leaving
him with a half-weight camp pack to carry out. On
the way out of the cave, his team left early, with the
rest of the expedition an hour behind in case there
were any problems. There were none, and the second
team did not catch up with Williams' team until they
reached the vehicles at the trailhead. Williams' team
of three made the 1,000-foot ascent from Deep Seas
Camp to the surface in three hours. After that and
the 1.5-mile surface hike, Williams' good leg was sore
and cramping from ascending more than 500 feet of
rope and managing all the stepping up and down
along the route while protecting the injured leg.
1. Tim Williams, Incident Report, 2 December 2015.
Comments: Under the right circumstances, al-
lowing time for a patient to rehabilitate and recover
underground can be the right decision. In warmer
caves or caves with camp or bivouac supplies, it can
be prudent strategy. This was a well-equipped expe-
dition with medically-trained participants, personal
first aid supplies, and access to an in-cave cache of
additional first aid supplies. Also, the planned week-
long camp in the cave provided good conditions for

we can avoid these situations. We all need to be con-

something."
Safety Break #3
(ALPINE) BUTTERFLY KNOT
Knots and ties can go by many names. Whether you call it an Alpine Butterfly, Butterfly, or Lineman's
Loop, this tie has many uses and should be part of your rigging repertoire. It is a midline knot that,
when tied properly, holds its shape and stays in place. Since you don't need the ends of the rope to tie
this knot, it can be used any place along the line. Some of its many uses include making an improvised
clip-in point or isolating a damaged spot in the rope. It can be load-
ed end-to-end or pulled from the bight, making it very versatile.
Remember: Knot-tying is a skill that should be practiced. There are
different ways to tie rope and get the same result, so figure out
what works for you. No matter what you call it or how you tie it,
always dress it and inspect it before using it.

equipment problem, no injury, no aid
During their Thanksgiving holiday expedition
in Nuevo LeÃ³n, five cavers entered Pozo de Mon-
temayor for a survey trip. Four cavers rappelled Ar-
gos Well (360 feet) without incident. As the fifth caver
passed the last of the pit's four rebelays, a section of
the rope "felt a little funny" as it passed through his
brake hand and then "hitched" as it passed through
his rack. This concerned him enough that he stopped
to inspect the rope and found that the sheath was
completely separated, revealing three inches of the
rope's core. The caver immediately clipped his as-
cenders above the damage and removed his rack from
the rope. Tying a butterfly knot in the rope, he was
able to isolate the bad spot. Performing a changeover
back to descent, he continued to the bottom. When
he reached his companions, he asked if any of them
had noticed a problem with the rope. They had not.
Since the other four cavers were less experienced in
vertical caving, they may not have had the experi-
ence to notice the beginning of a problem, or the rope
somehow became damaged between the fourth and
fifth cavers' use.
At the end of the trip, the first caver to ascend
past the butterfly noticed that weighting the rope had
pulled the rope's bad spot back into the knot. Luckily
the rope held, and a butterfly knot, this time with a
bigger bight, was retied. The rope came from a spool

Munoz and Storie kept a close eye on the water

gin to drop, they made another push for the entrance.
This time they were successful; they arrived at the
bottom of the entrance pit just as rescuers were mak-
ing their way into the cave.

4. Andrew Munoz, Incident Report, 3 February 2017.
Comments: In his report, the trip leader pro-
vides an excellent analysis of what the group did
wrong and what they did right. In retrospect, he be-
lieves their biggest error was in misjudging the force
of the water. Munoz writes, "The level of water was
passable but the force should have alerted me to the
fact that ascending was going to be an issue. If there
was any increase in flow it would be VERY hazard-
ous. However, I was suffering from risk hardening.
With five years of commercial cave guiding in Wa-
tiomo, New Zealand, I had developed great skills in
the water and was projecting that onto the group."
While the water may have caught them by surprise,
they were well-equipped for emergencies. Having ra-
tions, a stove, and a rugged emergency blanket likely
saved the pair's life as they sheltered in place, cold
and wet, for 14 hours. They also mentally prepared
for a wait of unknown duration. While struggling to
stay perched on their ledge, Munoz advised Storie,
"We have no way to tell how long this is going to last,
and things are probably going to get dark from time
to time. The most important thing is that we stay to-
gether as a team and don't turn on each other."

unspecified talus cave, New Jersey
other (bear attack), injury, no aid
Boy Scout leader Christopher Petronino (50)
wanted to show three Boy Scouts a talus cave he had
been visiting since the 1980s. He had been in the cave
two weeks prior. When they climbed up the hillside
to enter it, he stuck his foot into the 2-foot-wide en-
trance. A black bear grabbed his foot and pulled him
into the cave, then proceeded to bite him on the leg,
arm, neck, and head. Petronino hit the bear in the
head with his rock hammer, pulled his sweatshirt
over his head, curled into a fetal position, and yelled
to the Scouts to go and get help. The Scouts called
911, but couldn't tell the dispatcher exactly where
they were. They built a signal fire to help searchers
find them. Petronino instructed the Scouts to leave
some food at the entrance of the cave. They did and
then observed the bear exit the cave. A dog that was
with them then barked and chased the bear up the
hill. Petronino exited the cave and called 911 again,
an hour and 20 minutes after the first call. A helicop-
ter took Petronino to the Morristown Medical Center
for treatment of his severe lacerations.

exhaustion/difficulty on rope, no injury,

Five cavers entered Cemetery Pit to continue
working on a dome climb. On 27 December, they
found the dome was unusually wet SO they decided
not to climb that day. After three hours in the cave,
they started their exit. One at a time, three of the cav-
ers made their way up the 153-foot entrance pit. Tim
White climbed fourth and waited at the top for the
final caver. After a while, White realized he had been
waiting a long time. Ron Miller came back into the

cave to see if everything was alright. Just then, the 50-
year-old caver on rope yelled up, "Tim, I can't climb
anymore!" Checking the rope, White and Miller
could feel the rope was tensioned. He was only about
50 feet up the rope. They yelled back that they would
set up a haul system, but that he should keep trying
to climb on his own.
The drop had been rigged from bolts as a Y-
hang using a double figure-8 knot. The remaining
few feet of tail was rigged as an approach line. The
cavers on top used 30 feet of 8-mm cord to build a 3:1
haul system to pull the mainline up enough to create
slack in the mainline. With the climber's weight now
on the 8-mm cord, the mainline was rerigged as a 3:1
using webbing around a boulder as an anchor. Once
his weight was transferred back to the mainline, the
cavers began to haul him up. Even with only 4 feet
of throw, and significant friction at the bolts where
the rope went through a carabiner, the haul system
worked well enough that the fifth caver was hauled
the remaining 100 feet out of the pit. His difficulty on
rope was due to his wearing a large pack full of bolt-
ing and climbing gear on his back. The extra weight
pulling him backwards was too much for him to
overcome and he quickly became too exhausted to
continue climbing.
1. Tim White, personal communication, 8 May 2016.
2. Michael Hopkins, e-mail communication, 28 De-
cember 2016.
Comments: Using a tether to hang a heavy pack
below a caver is usually more efficient than wearing
it. Fortunately, the cavers on top were trained and
highly skilled in cave-rescue techniques; White is an
NCRC instructor.

2015 CAVE-DIVING ACCIDENTS AND INCIDENTS


********** 17 January 2015
Devils Eye Spring, Florida
fatality, illness
Jack Gregory (63) of Marietta, Georgia, and Gra-
ham Murray were planning to use diver propulsion
vehicles (DPVs) to get to the Sweet Surprise area in
Devils Eye Spring. They were then going to push the
DPVs through to the Mainland area, get back on the
main guideline, and use the DPVs to exit. According
to Murray, Gregory turned (aborted) the dive sud-
denly in Sweet Surprise. At one point, Murray turned
around to check on Gregory and found him slumped
over his scooter. Gregory's regulator was still in
his mouth, but he was unresponsive. Murray tried
to purge air from his own regulator into Gregory's
mouth, but Gregory was still unresponsive. Murray
returned to the surface for help. Gregory was recov-
ered by International Underwater Cave Rescue and
Recovery (IUCRR) divers.
Gregory was using sidemount tanks and had
used all of the air in his right tank. His left tank still
had 1800 psi. Friends report that Gregory had been
doing long, extensive dives all week. He was over-
loaded with gear, video equipment, and a heavy
DPV with added extra weight to make it negatively
buoyant.
1. Forrest Wilson, Incident Report, 27 January 2015.
Comments: Jack Gregory was a certified cave
diver with more than 100 logged cave dives. This
may have been too ambitious a dive for the physical
condition he was in at the time.


********** 25 February 2015
Sistema Camilo, Quintana Roo, Mexico
fatality, lost, medical issue
On a Wednesday afternoon, three divers began
their first dive during a trip to Quintana Roo. At ap-
proximately 1400, Keith Price (72), Tom Corwin, and
Bill Lavine entered Cenote Muchachos, one of the
cenote entrances to Sistema Camilo. The divers all
had many years of experience and were familiar with
this cave. Information later gathered from Price's
dive computer was used by Bil Phillips to reconstruct
this scenario: At approximately 35 minutes and some
1,800 feet penetration distance into the dive (under-
water depth of approximately 60 feet), the divers
reached their gas-turn-around pressures. The divers
signaled to each other and started their exit toward
the cave entrance. At this time, or very shortly there-
after, visual contact with Price was lost. One of the
divers claims that he saw Price's light to the right side
of the guideline and at a deeper depth than the other
two divers. The divers began a short search for the
missing diver, backtracking and looking with their
lights for signs of their buddy until they were forced
to leave the cave due to their gas reserves.
At approximately 1500, the two divers exited
Cenote Muchachos and asked one diver's wife if the
missing diver had surfaced. The answer was "No."
The two divers informed the caretakers at the cenote
site that there was a missing diver in the cave. By this
time, the surviving divers assumed that the victim
had either perished in the cave by exhausting his gas
supply, or he had exited the cave system by another
entrance. An underwater search team did a prelimi-
nary search of the main line and 150 feet down each
side passage. The only clue observed was a bubble
trail that led deeper into the cave. When that trail was
lost, the team ended their search for the day. Land
searches did not find Price at any of the cenotes they
checked.
The underwater search resumed the next day.
Divers again found and followed a bubble trail. It
eventually led to Cenote Camillo, where Price's two
dive cylinders were found at the water's edge; the
tanks had 450 and 500 psi respectively. A diveline
led into the jungle. The divers called out but heard
no response, SO they returned to Cenote Muchachos
to inform the surface team.
Once the surface team located the cenote, they
followed the guideline into the jungle and found
where Price had discarded his fins and helmet. The
guideline ended after 200 feet, but Price's trail was
discernible from branches he had broken, pointing in
his direction of travel. More than 1,600 feet from the
cenote, Price was found face down on the ground. He
was still wearing his mask with prescription lenses,
wetsuit, hood, cave diving harness, buoyancy com-
pensator, lights, and dive computer. An autopsy de-
termined that a heart attack was the cause of death.

Comments: In his report, Marchington explains
that, while many in the group had two-way radios,
there was some confusion in their operation that
made communication during the incident ineffec-
tive. He also suggests: "More people should have
had GPS receivers with the truck and route marked.
A GPS point of [the patient's] location would have re-
ally helped, and a GPS would have kept [her] on the
right track. Many of the people along did not have
their GPS on them. There were about 5 for 13 peo-
ple." If the patient had stayed in place, the other cav-
ers would have found her sooner, even without GPS
receivers.. A patient who wanders puts themselves
and others at greater risk.

Tumbling Rock Cave, Alabama
rockfall, injury and aid
During a group outing to Tumbling Rock Cave,
a large boulder unexpectedly dislodged and rolled
onto the foot of a girl (15), crushing her foot and an-
kle. Some members of the group stayed with the girl
while others went to get help. A call to 911 resulted
in several rescue groups arriving at the cave between
1800 and 2000.
The patient was about a mile into the cave, be-
yond a tight section known as the Suicide Passage.
Local cave rescue groups had participated in rescue
trainings in this area previously, and they knew that
a patient could not be transported in a FernoÂ® litter
through the Suicide Passage due to its small spaces
and twisting nature. The patient would either need
to be assisted through without a litter or the passage
would need to be widened. A caver experienced with
passage modification was sent in to widen the pas-
sage enough to move the patient through in a SKEDÂ®
(a more flexible type of litter). Due to safety concerns,
the passage modification was completed with hand
tools instead of explosives. Once the patient was
moved through the Suicide Passage, she was repack-
aged into a FernoR.
Evacuation teams worked together to carry the
patient over breakdown and up and down slopes
while maintaining a belay for safety. The patient was
brought to the surface at 0145 and flown to Erlanger
Health System for treatment of her injuries.

Neversink, Alabama
stranded, aid, no injury
A group of rock climbers went to Neversink to
rappel into the 162-foot-deep pit and then climb out.
One man began to rappel using an ATC belay device.
Twenty feet down, he realized that neither he, nor
anyone in his group, would be able to climb out, SO
he continued rappelling to the bottom. His friends at
the top called 911. A local caver was contacted and
was able to reach the stranded climber and supply
him with mechanical ascenders. After a little bit of
instruction, the man was able to ascend out.

Ellisons Cave, Georgia
difficulty on rope, injury and aid
A 22-year-old man was rescued from Ellisons
Cave after he was unable to climb out of Fantastic Pit
(586 feet deep). The man apparently ascended about
100 feet up the rope but was unable to continue fur-
ther. According to reports, this was due to some com-
bination of him becoming ill or exhausted and de-
hydrated due to an inefficient climbing
system. His partner climbed up to him
Feet
and was able to perform a pickoff and
lower him back to the ground. The man's
friend then climbed out of Fantastic Pit
and the Warm Up Pit (125 feet deep) and
called for help.
Several rescue groups responded.
At Fantastic Pit, they found the rope used
by the two adventurers. It was rigged in
an unconventional location, placing the
rope in a waterfall, and it was severely
abraded where it bent over the lip of the
pit. (Some rescuers have speculated that
even if the patient had been able to climb
out, the rope probably would have sev-
ered completely from the additional use
of the second person).
The patient was found, severely hy-
pothermic, at the bottom of Fantastic Pit.
His hypothermia had progressed to the
point where he had begun removing his
clothes, a behavior known as paradoxical
undressing.
Rescuers dressed the patient, provided him with
food and water, and encouraged him to get up, walk,
and move until he warmed up. He was then placed in
a harness and raised up both drops with rescuers en-
couraging him to keep moving his limbs and to stay
awake. The rescue operation took about six hours.

Comments: Paradoxical undressing has been
reported in cases of both moderate and severe hy-
pothermia. As the body loses heat, blood vessels
contract in order to keep heat near the body's core
and vital organs. Eventually, the muscles necessary
for vasoconstriction tire and relax. Warm blood then
flows back to the extremities, and patients may sud-
denly feel hot. With mental alertness already com-
promised, patients do not realize the folly of remov-
ing their clothes. One study suggests that up to 50%
of hypothermia fatalities displayed some degree of
paradoxical undressing. This patient is extremely
fortunate that he was young and physically fit and
that help arrived when it did.
According to reports, the two men were experi-
enced rock climbers but had no caving experience.

Ray Keeler led a small group of cavers on a
weekend trip to place registers in several Tonto Na-

ters in four horizontal caves. On Sunday, the group
went to a cave that can be entered either with a 15-

exception of Keeler, the group was new to vertical
work, and they chose to rappel in and ascend back
out for practice. Under Keeler's tutelage, the group

caver, there were several advantages leading to suc-

was accessible by rescuers from both sides.

volume 30, number 2, pages 4-7, Spring 2016.
Comments: Cavers traveling through virgin or
newly discovered cave must be extra cautious about
handholds, footholds, loose rocks, and false floors.
Over time, as dozens to hundreds of cavers travel a
popular route, loose rocks get moved, weak holds
break off, and things on the walls and floors that can
collapse generally do. When one is exploring "new"
cave, the caver is in many cases the only thing that
has come along in thousands of years to upset the
balance of things. In some cases, large rocks may be
only precariously perched, just waiting for a caver to
come along and disturb the equilibrium.

Safety Break #4
HYPOTHERMIA
Be careful of getting cold-even when it's hot outside. Caves take on the average yearly temperature
of the area in which they are located. Even caves located in warm tropical regions are usually cooler
than your body's temperature, which means that hypothermia can happen in almost any cave. Hypo-
thermia occurs when your body loses heat faster than it can produce heat. Fatigue, injury, and getting
lost or stuck can increase the risk of hypothermia. In a cave, everything around you will rob you of body
heat-including rock, water, and even the ambient air temperature.
Here are a few tips that can help ward off hypothermia:
Find a place out of water and away from windy passages. Sit on your pack to insulate yourself from
the ground.
Add warm, dry, clothing. If you're wet, try to change out of the wet clothing and put on something
dry.
Wool and synthetic fabrics dry faster than cotton, and wool maintains its thermal properties even
when wet.
Put on a hat. You lose heat everywhere, but your head is usually more exposed, even when wearing
a helmet. Wear a beanie under your helmet.
Keep a large trash bag in the space in your helmet or in a first aid kit. It might not feel very warm,
but putting a trash bag over yourself creates a vapor barrier to block wind and creates a smaller
air space you have to warm. (Be sure to tear a small hole to keep your head exposed.) Even better,
add a candle to create a heat tent, also known as a "Palmer Furnace."
Eat some food. Calories are potential energy, which are needed to generate body heat.
Hydrate. Drinking water isn't appealing when you're cold- but it is essential. Trying to stay warm
takes energy, and if you don't drink water, then dehydration will soon be an additional problem.

Comments: The anchor had been inspected by
several people and had previously supported a sin-
gle person load about ten times prior to the accident.
The anchor failed shortly after being placed under a
two-person load. When the two cavers pushed out
from the wall with their legs, they changed not only
the force but the direction of loading on the anchor.
The fall zone was cleared moments before the inci-
dent occurred. This is a good reminder that anchors
of questionable integrity should always be backed
up or back-tied. Anchors must be re-evaluated when
the size or direction of load changes. Critical-point
anchors must be bombproof, and people should stay
out of the fall zone whenever possible.

"I was in Tumbling Rock photographing one of the

to stay out of their way and move back in front of
the group, I slipped and fell about four feet, landing
on a sandy surface on top of the one football-sized

cussed at myself and got back up." But due to some
pain he was experiencing, Davis allowed the group
to unpackage the mock patient and package him into
the Ferno. He was carried from the cave by a large
group of instructors and students.
1. John Maddox, Incident Report, 2 June 2016.
Comments: In a large mock rescue, there can be
a lot of commotion, causing one to become distracted
and have an accident. Rescuers and others involved
must always look out for their own safety first. While
it's never good to get hurt in a cave, doing SO in the
middle of a large-scale mock rescue can lead to a rap-
id evacuation.

A group of eight experienced women cavers en-

times but managed to land on her feet at the bottom.
A quick assessment found that her ear was badly cut,

and their guides were far underground. Two police
officers entered the cave to alert the groups about

Comments: In interviews with Hidden River

that is elevated above expected flood levels. Waiting
for floodwaters to recede is often the best option in a
flood situation. In this incident, the guides decided to

2. Cliff Thorsen, Incident Report, 14 February 2017.
Comments: After the first incident, Thorsen in-
structed his friend in better use of the figure-8 device,
including keeping his non-braking hand below the
device and holding the rope against the attaching car-
abiner (during the first rappel, his non-braking hand
was on the rope above the rappel device). Thorsen
also rigged a secondary rope at the second drop as
a precaution. It is generally preferable to practice
single-rope technique (SRT) skills for the first time in
a controlled environment outside of a cave. Also, fig-
ure-8 devices have largely fallen out of favor among
cavers. A figure-8 on a cave trip may imply that the
user is less experienced. Less experienced cavers re-
quire more supervision and coaching. Contingency
rigging and bottom belays can add extra layers of
safety when applicable.

PERSONAL FIRST-AID KITS
What's in your cave pack? Lights? Food and water? Clothing? What about a personal first-aid kit?
Experienced cavers tend to streamline their pack and lighten what they carry, and this sometimes
means taking out items that aren't frequently used but that can be worth their weight in gold when
they are needed. Many pre-packaged first aid kits have items that don't work well underground. In-
stead, consider building a custom first-aid kit that can fit in a Nalgene bottle or small Pelicanâ¢ case.
Sprains and breaks are among the mostly likely injuries underground, so cater to that type of injury.
Also, consider adding multipurpose items to your first-aid kit.
Duct tape can be used to cover small wounds or hold a splint in place, and a long, twisted strip of
tape can serve as a sling.
Extra plastic sandwich bags are also versatile. Fill a plastic bag with clean water and poke a small
hole to help irrigate a wound, or use it to cover bandages so they stay dry and mud-free.
Bandanas have many uses.
Include some protective gloves, sample packs of Neosporin, and a few dosages of over-the-counter
drugs like ibuprofen or Imodium, and you're on your way to having a well-supplied first-aid kit.

Three cavers entered Laurel Caverns with a spe-

of the cave known as the Ball Room, one of the cavers
(42) slipped and fell. She landed in a way that caused
a rock to hit her on the head, just below her helmet,
and she lost consciousness for about 20 seconds. Her

contacted cave staff for assistance. The woman reported
feeling nauseated but was able to make it out of the cave
with minimal assistance. She was driven to a hospital

Simmons-Mingo Cave System,
West Virginia
stranded, no injury, no aid
A planned through trip from the Historic En-
trance to the Zarathustra Entrance in the Simmons-
Mingo Cave System took about 11 hours longer than
expected for four cavers. Before entering, the group
hiked to the Zarathustra Entrance. Everything at the
entrance looked normal, and the cavers could feel
the usual breeze issuing from the cave. They then en-
tered the Historic Entrance shortly before noon.
Eight hours later, the group reached the inside
of the Zarathustra Entrance and noticed more water
than usual dripping into the cave. Exiting from this
side is aided by a permanently rigged rope that can
be used as a handline to climb up a slope into the
bottom of the entrance opening. On this trip howev-
er, the cavers found that the small hole that the rope
hangs through was blocked with a rock choke.
The cavers did not want to disturb the rock pile
over their heads, and they could not continue up.
Their only option was to turn around and go out the
way they had come in. This backtracking added more
than 10 hours to their trip for which they had not pre-
pared. One member had water purification tablets
that enabled the cavers to drink from the cave stream
(which rose continuously during their trip), prevent-
ing dehydration. They emerged from the cave at 0700
the next morning.

cludes, "The Simmons Mingo through trip between
the Historic and Zarathustra entrances is a lengthy,
complicated, demanding trip for many cavers, and
lack of physical, mental, and resource preparedness
for essentially having to do it twice could very easily
have a less fortunate result than our trip did."

SURFACE WATCH or CALL-OUT PERSON
Surface watch or call-out person refers to a person outside of your caving party who knows
where you are and when to expect you out of the cave. This person can be a significant other,
family member, or fellow caver. Having a dependable surface watch can significantly reduce
delays in a rescue response if it's needed. The surface watch should know whom to call to initi-
ate a rescue in your area.
Things to consider telling your designated surface watch:
Use the real or most common name of the cave! Do not use a nickname that no one else
would recognize. You might call it "Cake Lady Pit," but does anyone else?
The location of the cave.
The names and contact information for other individuals on the trip.
Experience level of the group.
What the trip's objectives are such as surveying, bolt climbing, or pushing leads.

********** 3 September 2016
Carpenter-Swago Cave System,
West Virginia
lost, aid, no injury
During the 2016 Old-Timers Reunion (OTR) in
Dailey, West Virginia, five cavers decided to do a
through trip in the Carpenter-Swago Cave System.
The trip leader knew the cave had been closed by the
landowner, but decided to proceed anyway. He had
led through trips in the system previously when the
cave was open.
In his report, the trip leader describes the cave
system, "Swago is a wet cave with four waterfalls.
The first is an open-air pit with a small waterfall
which is traditionally rigged off of a tree. The other
three waterfalls are situated along a stream passage
inside the cave. The bottom of the fourth waterfall is
the junction between Carpenter and Swago. Carpen-
ter has a series of three drops. The first is also located
in an open-air pit; it is rigged utilizing fixed bolts. The
next two drops are inside the cave. All three drops
are close enough SO that they can be rigged with a
single 300-foot rope. Beyond the third drop, the cave
is horizontal."
The group planned to travel from the Swago
Entrance to the Carpenter Entrance, SO the Carpenter
side had to be rigged first. The trip leader continues,
"The plan was to rig the rope on the first and second
drops, but not the third. On all the previous through
trips I had done, we used a bypass crawl that brought
us to the bottom of the second drop, without hav-
ing to first climb up the third drop. Our plan was to
make use of that bypass crawl on this trip, as well."
At the Swago Entrance, they rigged to a tree for the
first drop and carried a second rope that would be

pulled down behind them on the next three pitches.
The cavers, intending to travel quickly, carried packs
with minimal food, water, and emergency supplies.
Everyone rappelled the first drop without incident.
They traveled a short distance to the second drop.
Once everyone was down, they pulled the rope
down, committing themselves to continuing through
the cave to the Carpenter Entrance. When the rope
came down, they realized that they had left two
packs at the top of the pit. One of the packs belonged
to the trip leader and contained webbing that was to
be used for handlines and his ascenders, which he
had chosen not to wear while rappelling. The cavers
had no choice but to continue on.
When they reached the area of the bypass crawl
that would lead them to the Carpenter entrance, the
trip leader scouted ahead. The crawl looked smaller
than he remembered SO he sent one of the other cav-
ers in to check. That caver, which had never been in
this cave before, returned to say that the crawl did
not look safe and probably wasn't the way (it was, in
fact, the correct route). The group spent the next 12
hours looking for the way on. By now they were cold
and almost out of food and water. They traveled back
to the bottom of the last drop in Swago and waited
for rescue.
The group discussed how long it might take for

vigilant for unprepared cavers at a weekend caving

with led trips and workshops. We should help set up
beginning cavers for success by making sure they are
eating, staying hydrated, and otherwise prepared for
the particular trip.

The AHJ is the public safety official that has responsibility for a specific area. Conveniently, in most
cases, they all have the same phone number, and that number is 911.
The actual entity may vary from state to state and locale to locale. These agencies may or may not actu-
ally take part in a cave rescue, but they will retain the responsibility.
Some examples of AHJ include:
State police
County sheriff
NPS park ranger
BLM manager
State game warden
State park ranger
Within city limits, possibly local services
The AHJ may then contact local cave rescue groups or individuals. A good relationship between the AHJ
and cavers can be established by training and practicing cave rescue techniques together.

Bloomington Cave, Utah
exhaustion, aid, no injury
A family's Thanksgiving outing to Blooming-
ton Cave proved to be too much for a man in his 50s.
After making his way deep into the cave, the man
became exhausted and asked his nephew to bring
back help. While other family members stayed with
the man, the nephew found his way out and called
911. When rescuers reached the man, they found he
was unhurt but very tired and nauseous. They en-
couraged him along, letting him take as many breaks
as he needed. As they neared the entrance, they used
a haul system to help him up a steep incline, but he
otherwise made it out under his own power. The res-
cue operation took 10 hours to complete.

com, 25 November 2016.
Comments: Caving can be very strenuous, over-
working muscles that do not often see use in everyday
life. This combined with poor physical conditioning,
dehydration, and poor nutrition make exhaustion an
ever-present possibility, even among experienced
cavers. With newer cavers, we should be even more
vigilant for signs of exhaustion. Several incidents in
this issue serve to illustrate that point.


********** 2 December 2016
Bisaro Anima, British Columbia, Canada
rockfall, injury, no aid
A group of experienced cavers traveled by he-
licopter to the remote Bisaro karst to conduct a sur-
vey trip in Bisaro Anima. An underground camp was
established at -1,150 feet for a multi-day stay. On 2
December, two cavers were exploring and rigging
pitches ahead of the others. Claire Gougeon (37) was
shuttling gear to assist her partner, who was rig-
ging a pitch and needing supplies. Along the way,
she came to an exposed climb that was the route she
previously used. Not wanting to do this climb again,
she elected to climb up and over large, but appar-
ently stable, boulders. When she pushed off of one
round boulder, it shifted and pinched her left middle
fingertip between the boulder and the rock wall be-
fore falling the rest of the way down the slope. She
experienced pain but continued caving to meet up
with her partner.
When she removed her glove, she found the
fingertip cut open three-fourths of the way around
starting from the base of the finger nail and bleeding
profusely. It was cleaned in some fast-moving water
nearby, but she and her partner otherwise had no
first-aid supplies with them. They met up with an-
other team and the finger was bandaged with gauze
and she kept it elevated. Gougeon, who is a nurse,
and another caver with emergency-medicine experi-
ence judged it to be a bad cut. They determined that
even to exit the cave and call in the helicopter would
not get her to the hospital in time to allow for stitch-
es.
The next day Gougeon decided to take an easy
day and exit the following day with the rest of the
group as originally scheduled. The group exited the
cave, flew out by helicopter, and Gougeon was driv-
en to a hospital for x-rays. The x-rays showed that the
middle finger tip bone was broken and in fact had
been crushed. She was given a tetanus shot and anti-
biotics and the injury was bandaged and left to heal.
On-going issues required a return visit and a second
opinion. On December 10, just over a week after the
initial injury, she went for emergency surgery and re-
ceived two pins and eight stitches to treat the injury.

cember 2016.
2. Claire Gougeon, phone communication, 23 De-
cember 2016.
Comments: It was likely a good call to stay in
place rather than try to evacuate after a full day of
activity. A first-aid kit that contains butterfly strips
or steri-strips can assist with deep cut injuries when
evacuation to medical aid is delayed. Short lengths
of VetRapTM, ACETM Bandages, or GorillaÂ® Tape are
easy to carry and can be invaluable when needing to
close, compress, and protect a wound in wilderness
(cave) environments.

Binkley Cave System, Indiana
flooding, aid, no injury
Seven cavers entered the Binkley Cave System
on a rainy December afternoon. The forecast at the
time predicted less than an inch of rain for the day.
Their survey destination was a several-hour trip into
the cave, to a section few cavers are familiar with.
They had left word with a surface watch that their
out time would be 0300.
When the cavers reached a section known as the
D&B Crawl, they encountered standing water in the
crawlway with low air space. One of the cavers did

ties. The biggest logistical problems now facing the
rescue operation were the freezing temperatures out-
side and the lack of cavers familiar with the route to
the missing cavers' destination.
The first initial response teams (IRT) entered
the cave at 1310 carrying extra food and hypotherm-
ia supplies. From Mirza's report, "IRT 1 was three
people, one of which was familiar with the in-cave
crew's objective. Their objective was to head to the
point furthest in the cave that would hamper the
in-cave crew's exiting due to high water, the D&B
Crawl, and report back on the conditions by 2300. IRT
2 was two people, both strong cavers but less familiar
with the cave, and their objective was to accompany
IRT 1 to the Mountain Room, which we considered
a high probability for a location for the in-cave crew
to be holed up, then split off and report back by 1700
which would give us guidance planning for the next
operational period."
At 1730, IRT 1 made contact with the cavers; they
had been waiting out the flood in Fantastic Avenue.
The team leader of IRT 1 and two of the missing cav-
ers exited the cave at 2250, reporting that everyone
was alive and well. The other members of IRT 1 were
following with the remaining cavers at a slower pace.
An evacuation team was sent in to assist and three
more cavers exited at 0240. The remaining two cavers
exited 15 minutes later.

Comments: The cavers were aware of rain in
the area, but decided to continue with the trip based
on an overall prediction of less than one inch in the
forecast. With the hindsight of knowing the final to-
tal was actually quadruple that, it is easy to question
the cavers' decision to continue. In fact, one planned
member of the team decided to sit out the trip based
on the uncertainty of the weather. However, the cav-
ers were making an informed decision based on the
best information they had at the time. Long cave sys-
tems can be especially unforgiving in the face of un-
certain weather. Besides typically having large catch-
ment areas for floodwaters, long caves can take many
hours to traverse. This trip was originally planned to
be nearly 20 hours long. Weather decisions have to
be made based on conditions and forecasts up to the
moment of entering, but conditions can change rap-
idly after the cavers are underground.
The rescue response worked smoothly and effi-
ciently. This is a result of years of training and prepa-
ration in the area that have resulted in cavers, res-
cuers, and landowners working together to achieve
positive rescue outcomes.

fatality, medical
Mike Schultz (61) of Ohio died of a heart attack
while diving in the Devil's System at Ginnie Springs
near High Springs, Florida, on 3 April. Schultz was a
highly experienced and trained diver using an Op-
tima Rebreather, for which he was certified.
Shultz and a dive buddy entered the system us-
ing Dive Propulsion Vehicles (scooters), which they
took into the cave for a distance of about 2,150 feet.
They then left their scooters, and swam to an area
called Sweet Surprise at a distance of about 3,100
feet. (When using a scooter, it is common to use it to
reach an area of the cave and then leave it to complete
the dive plan while swimming.) After their visit to the
planned area, they turned the dive, with Shultz follow-
ing his buddy back to their scooters SO they could exit.
During the exit, Shultz began to shows signs
of distress by having difficulty performing routine
skills. Shultz indicated he was having trouble man-
aging his scooter and wanted to swim instead, but
he had trouble swimming as well. His buddy began
to tow him out, but eventually there was a complete
loss of buoyancy leading to a silt out. At that time
a cave-diving instructor, Ted McCoy, encountered
them while teaching a class, and he attempted to as-
sist. Shortly after that it became evident that Shultz
was deceased, and a recovery team was formed to
recover the body.
An autopsy identified the cause of death as
drowning, and the event that precipitated the drown-
ing was a heart attack with a blocked coronary ar-
tery.

A man died while diving in the Orange Grove
Sink at Peacock Springs State Park. A formal report
was not available, but the accident was likely caused
by the diver attempting a trip beyond his training
level. He followed another team's dive line, which
was removed while he was still in the cave.

Eagles Nest, Florida
2 fatalities, cause unknown
"The rescue divers were private volunteers because
the expertise necessary to retrieve the men exceeded the
authorities' abilities."
Three men visited Eagles Nest as part of a three-
day dive trip. The underwater cave is notorious
for its difficulty and at least eight people have died
while diving its depths. A sign at the entrance to the
cave proclaims, "STOP. PREVENT YOUR DEATH.
THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS CAVE WORTH DY-
ING FOR!" Patrick Peacock (53) and Chris Ritten-
meyer (38) were experienced cave divers and felt
confident about their ability to explore the cave.
Their friend, Justin Blakely, decided to stay closer to
the surface. They planned to meet up again in the af-
ternoon at 1500.
Peacock and Rittenmeyer did not show up at
the scheduled rendezvous time, SO Blakely waited
another 30 minutes, and then another 30 minutes. At
1800 there was still no sign of the missing divers, and
Blakely called 911. A search team did not initially
find the two men. The search was resumed the next
day, and the bodies of Peacock and Rittenmeyer were
found and removed from the cave.

length their dive plan of traveling through the cave
to the Cuzan Nah loop. Their starting and ending
point would be Grand Cenote. Their other objective
was for Morano to take video footage of Arriaga and
the cave. During most of the dive, the two stayed
close together with Arriaga leading, making note of
permanently placed markers and leaving their own
when their route deviated from the mainline. As they
approached No Name Cenote, Morano took pictures
of the light shining into the water. When he was done,
Arriaga was nowhere in sight.
He searched briefly, checking nearby cenotes
where she might have exited, but decided that she
must have gone on ahead of him. As he made his way
back to Grand Cenote, Morano picked up the mark-
ers and dive lines they had placed. At Grand Cenote,
he did not find Arriaga.
Morano went back into the cave and came
across another dive team. They communicated that
they had seen a solo diver fitting Arriaga's descrip-
tion near Cenote Ho-Tul (that team later noted that
Arriaga at the time did not show any signs of being
in distress). Morano did not find her there. By now,
he was running low on air, SO he left the cave to get
fresh tanks. There, he ran into the team he met un-
derwater and informed them of what had happened.
He then entered the cave again for another search,
replacing his markers as he went. Back in the Cuzan
Nah loop, he found Arriaga's body. Both of her tanks
were empty. He pulled her to the surface of a nearby
cenote where other divers tried to resuscitate her.
Morano swam her body back to Grand Cenote and
turned it over to waiting authorities.
1. Alessandro Morano, Incident Report, undated.
2. Ron Engle, Letter to IANTD, undated.
Comments: Morano lost track of Arriaga in the
Cuzan Nah loop. It is not known if she swam ahead
and accidentally started around the loop again, got
behind Morano and swam back the way they had
come, or had made her way ahead and gone beyond
the loop only to be confused by the second team's
dive line and SO turned back. Whatever happened, as
soon as Morano removed their jump lines and mark-
ers (because he assumed she was ahead of him), it
would have been almost impossible for her to find
her way out. Losing track of a dive buddy, and then
removing necessary markers before they are located,
is a breach of cave-diving protocol, and here it had
deadly consequences.

The Steve Hudson Award
for Service to Cave Rescue
Steve Hudson (NSS 11444 RL, FE, OS) was a founder of the National Cave Rescue Commission (NCRC)
in the late 1970s and supported it through the next four decades. He served as one of its first instructors, as the
Southeastern Region coordinator, as the national coordinator, and as the training coordinator. Steve owned
and ran Pigeon Mountain Industries (PMI) and was an internationally acknowledged expert on rope and
rope rescue. He used his experience to raise standards and practice in industrial rope access as well. He was
a founder of the Society of Professional Rope Access Technicians (SPRAT) and an author of High Angle Rescue
Techniques. Steve served as Deputy Director of Emergency Services for Walker County, Georgia, and was a
recipient of its Distinguished Service Award. He was also the recipient of the International Technical Rescue's
Lifetime Achievement Award. Steve donated countless hours to teaching rescue techniques to make cavers
safer. Steve was taken from us prematurely in 2013 in Puerto Rico, a place he grew to love after traveling to
teach cave rescue there. In recognition of his lifetime of service, the National Speleological Society created the
Steve Hudson Award for Service to Cave Rescue.
In 2016, the NSS bestowed the inaugural Steve Hudson award on Diane Cousineau (NSS 9284 RL, FE,
SH). Diane completed her first NCRC training in 1986 and is now the lead instructor for the NCRC instructor
qualification course. She is the captain of Walker County Emergency Services Station 21, which is responsible
for cave, cliff, and ground search for the county. Her team also provides mutual aid for cave rescues in other
Georgia counties, as well as in Alabama and Tennessee, and has accomplished many successful rescues in
technically difficult caves, including Ellisons Cave. Diane was the 2015 recipient of her department's Distin-
guished Service Award.

Simple things that might save your life
Bill Putnam, Editor
In preparing this issue, several incidents in the reports
have weighed heavily on my mind. In one case, this was made
worse by the fact that I participated in the rescue of the injured
caver and was present when she died, tragically and
unexpectedly, just before reaching the surface. I want to use
this space to talk about a few things that were involved in
several serious incidents. I hope that this discussion will
prompt you to consider your own caving habits and practices.
We all need to think hard about the risks we take in caving
and what we can do to reduce them.
The first thing I want to talk about is probably one of the
most basic rules of vertical caving. Never, ever, hang a rope in
a pit or down a drop without first tying a knot in the end. It is
not unusual to wind up with a rope that doesn't reach bottom.
As several incidents reported in this issue demonstrate,
without a knot you can easily rappel right off the end of the
rope and fall, suffering serious injury or death.
Many cavers tie a figure-8 loop in the end, providing a
convenient loop to stand in and use during a changeover from
rappel to climb if the rope comes up short. It's a habit every
caver should cultivate. Oh sure - sometimes it's a short drop
and you can look and see that the rope is on bottom. Do it
anyway, SO that it becomes a habit, and you won't forget to do
it some day when you can't see and don't think to look.
Every caver has a responsibility to make sure this is done.
Every caver must be responsible for understanding, inspecting
and checking the rigging, and for pointing out or correcting
dangerous conditions and situations. Caving is a team
endeavor for most of us, and we have to look out for each
other as well as for ourselves. In a dramatic and tragic
example of the failure to remember this, Karen Prowett was
killed at Stephens Gap Pit when these simple but critical
issues were overlooked. Remember your responsibility and
exercise it.
There are quite a few incidents in this issue involving falls
due to out-of-control rappels. Such incidents are almost
always avoidable. In addition to refraining from engaging in
"speed rappels" and leaping around like television stunt men,
there are several techniques that can make rappelling a lot
safer while still allowing cavers to enjoy it.
It is apparent from these reports that many cavers do not
thoroughly understand how their rappelling and climbing
equipment works. Competent vertical cavers know how to
control and tie off their rappel devices, and how to add and
remove friction while on rappel. They know how to change
over between rappel and ascent. They know how and when to
use belays. They also know that experience is best obtained by
starting with small drops and progressing to deeper ones.
Many cavers use a bottom belay for protection when
rappelling. It is a simple technique, consisting of having a
caver at the bottom of a drop holding the rope and ready to
apply weight to the rope. The belayer should wrap the rope
around his hips, holding the main line in one hand and the
loose end in the other. The belayer then pulls down, or sits in
the loop if necessary, to apply weight to the main line. The
additional load will slow and usually stop the descent of a
caver rappelling with almost any commonly used rappel
device. The technique is most popular in regions where the
pits tend to be somewhat roomy at the bottom and where
rockfall is not severe.
The bottom belay is very useful in frequently visited
caves, or well traveled and established routes in cave systems,
where loose rock has been removed from the lip. It may be
more risky and perhaps less useful in virgin caves or in alpine
environments of shattered rock, where rockfall is a serious and
constant threat or where narrow shafts leave no place for a
belayer to hide.
It is true that there is some risk to the belayer, even under
good conditions. The belay is most effective when the belayer
is directly below the rappeller, requiring exposure to rockfall
or impact by a falling caver. But the risk to the belayer can
usually be mitigated. The belayer can often stand away from
the rockfall zone or take shelter under an overhang. A sling
and carabiner can be used if necessary to redirect the rope and
allow belaying from a safer location. It is important to realize
that in order for the belay to be fully effective, it must be
applied quickly and correctly. You may only have a second to
apply the belay and stop or slow a fall. It is wise to practice in
a controlled environment before belaying in a cave.
Certainly there are circumstances in which the risk to the
belayer is too great - for example in narrow pits with lots of
loose rock, where the belayer cannot take shelter. In such
cases a self-belay might be preferred. But the bottom belay is
a good general tool that all cavers should know. Learn and
understand the technique, and use it whenever circumstances
permit. You never know when someone might need it.
Another technique popular with European cavers and used
by some in the U.S. is to rappel with a self-belay, composed
of a prusik or similar knot attached to the rope below the
rappel device. The knot is fashioned out of a short sling
attached to the caver's harness or leg loop and is held open by
the rappeller's braking hand during descent. It must be short
enough to grip the rope below the rappel device when
released. Properly rigged, the knot is easily loosened after use.
Cavers experimented in the past with the Spelean Shunt
and other self-belay techniques employing a prusik or
ascender placed above the rappel device. These tend to jam
and are often very difficult to release afterward. The European
method works much better.
Some cavers think that belays are for beginners, and that
anyone who needs one should not be doing a deep pit. This is
a dangerous fallacy, because any caver can be hit by a falling
rock and stunned or knocked out while on rappel. Some
believe that is what happened to Alexia Hampton in Surprise
Pit. Whatever the reason for her fall, the use of a bottom belay
or self-belay might well have saved her life.
So take a few moments as you read these reports. Think
about these things. Think about Karen and Alexia. Think
about your fellow cavers and family. And be careful.

Overview of the 1996, 1997, and 1998 Reports
Following the example of previous issues of American
Caving Accidents, the reports have been separated into two
general categories: regular caving and cave diving, and then
further classified by result or outcome and by causes and
contributing factors. Once again, I have used the category
"difficulty on rope," to encompass such problems as becoming
stuck at the lip of a pit, clothing or hair caught in the rappel
device, jammed rappel safety, or simply becoming unable to
ascend or descend. My intent is to better describe these
situations, which might otherwise be lumped under "stuck,"
"trapped/stranded," or perhaps "equipment problem."
In reporting the number of incidents versus NSS
membership totals, only the serious incidents were used. The
reader should also be aware that the members of the society
make up only a portion of the population of active cavers.
Further, not all incidents are reported to ACA. These numbers
should not be considered reliable indicators of accident rates
for caving, or used to draw conclusions about the relative
degree of risk or danger involved in caving.
Incident Results
Fatalities
There was one fatal incident in 1996. A man rappelled into
a flooded pit without climbing gear and either drowned or
died of hypothermia when he was unable to escape the pool at
the bottom.
In 1997 there were four fatal accidents reported. One
involved a person who suffered a heart attack in Reeves Cave,
Indiana. An inexperienced and possibly intoxicated caver was
killed when he fell while climbing on rocks at the entrance of
New River Cave, Virginia. One caver was killed when she
rappelled off the end of a rope at Stephens Gap Pit, Alabama,
and fell over 100 feet. A few months later, another caver was
killed in Fern Cave, Alabama when she lost control of her
rappel and fell about 50 feet in Surprise Pit.
There were four fatalities in 1998. Two involved heart
attacks while caving. A hiker was killed by falling ice at Big
Four Ice Caves, Washington. An inexperienced caver died
after falling down a slope in the entrance of Spring Hill
Saltpeter Cave, Tennessee. That incident has resulted in a
lawsuit brought by the victim's family against the cave
owners.
Injury and Aid
These incidents resulted in injury to one or more people,
who then required help in order to exit the cave. While many
of these involved rescue call-outs and outside assistance, some
were resolved, without calling for rescue, by the caving
parties themselves. The development of several small-party
and self-rescue training courses is a welcome addition to cave
rescue training available in the US. Active cavers should
consider obtaining some level of cave rescue training, and
should develop small group and self-rescue capabilities SO that
they can help their companions when necessary.
Aid, no injury
The majority of these incidents are rescues of individuals
that cavers often refer to as "spelunkers." They are typically
poorly equipped and inexperienced, and are often stranded
when they break or lose their flashlights, run out of batteries,
or get lost. A number of these incidents involved people
stranded in pits without ascending gear after rappelling or
descending hand-over-hand. Others involved cavers who did
not know how to use their ascending equipment. Several
incidents involved exhausted cavers stranded in a cave or on
rope. Flooding and rockfall entrapments also accounted for
several incidents.
Injury, no aid
These incidents resulted in injuries ranging from scrapes
and bruises to sprained ankles and broken fingers. In each
case, the victim was able to exit the cave with minimal
assistance from members of the caving party.
No Consequence
Many of these incidents are of the "near miss" category.
They are included SO that the reader will be aware of the many
things that can go wrong. Some of these offer good
illustrations of effective self-rescue or small-group rescue.
Incident Types
Acetelyne Hazard or Explosion
There was one acetylene incident in 1996, resulting in a
chemical burn. None were reported in 1997 or 1998.
Bad Air
One of the 1996 incidents and one 1998 incident involved
bad air in caves. For a discussion of bad air in caves see Bill
Mixon's article in this issue and Bill Elliott's article in the last
issue of ACA (NSS News, December 1997 Part 2).
Caver Fall
Falls remain the leading cause of accident and injury. The
reported causes and contributing factors include: climbing
rock without a belay, using cable ladders without a belay,
improper footwear (tennis shoes), inexperience, use of hand-
held flashlights and lanterns, climbing or descending ropes
hand-over-hand, rappelling off the end of the rope, and out-of-
control rappels. Cheap helmets and elastic chinstraps continue
to be a problem. Remember: your helmet makes a statement.
The hand-over-hand technique continues to claim its
victims among the growing population of inexperienced and
poorly equipped spelunkers. It also claimed one experienced
caver in Goochland Cave, Kentucky in 1996 and another in
McBrides Cave, Alabama, in 1997.
Several serious accidents occurred when cavers lost
control on rappel or rappelled off the end of the rope and fell
in pits. There were three incidents in 1996 in which cavers lost
control on rappel and fell. One was caused by rockfall and
another was caused by a high-speed "show off" rappel.
In 1997 two cavers rappelled off the ends of their ropes
and fell. One caver was killed at Stephens Gap Pit, Alabama,
and another was injured at Freeman's Pit, Indiana. Another
caver was killed in Fern Cave, Alabama, when she lost control
of her rappel. A 1998 incident resulted in serious injury for a
novice rappeller at Moaning Cavern, California.

floods without difficulty.
There were two flooding
incidents in 1997. Several cavers were trapped in Glow Worm
Cave, Tennessee, when they entered via a low crawl in bad
weather. Five cavers were trapped, including one caver who
broke his leg, and three others injured during a flood in
McBrides Cave, Alabama, when a group attempted a pull-
down trip during bad weather.
There was a minor flooding incident in Bowden Cave,
West Virginia, in 1998, in which cavers waited out a flood
pulse before exiting.
The lesson taught by all these incidents is simple: pay
attention to the weather conditions. Check the forecast for the

caving area, and be alert for the possibility of flooding. If the
cave is known to flood and you don't have a clear forecast, go
somewhere else. It's just not worth the risk of entrapment,
rescue, media attention, closed caves, injury, or death.
Hypothermia
Hypothermia is usually a secondary result in the reported
incidents, occurring subsequent to cavers becoming injured,
stranded, or trapped in a cave. In 1996, it is believed to have
contributed to the drowning death of a man who rappelled into
a flooded pit without ascending gear. There were several

---------- Page 6 ----------
incidents involving lost or stranded cavers in which some of
those rescued required hospitalization and treatment for
hypothermia. Remember: hypothermia can kill you all by
itself, but it also impairs your brain, which makes it easier to
make bigger mistakes.
Illness
There were ten incidents involving illness while caving.
One 1996 incident required an unplanned bivouac in a cave.
Heart attacks while caving accounted for one fatality in 1997
and two in 1998. There was one case of histoplasmosis and
one possible rabies exposure, both in 1998.
Lost
Most of these incidents involved untrained and ill-
equipped cavers with little experience. Many escalate to the
"stranded" category when the batteries run out. Several of
these incidents also involved hypothermia, with a few cases
resulting in hospitalization.
Rockfall/Ice Fall
Rockfall remains a serious source of accidents and
incidents, causing several injuries and rescues and four cases
of entrapment. One of the entrapments was caused by a caver
attempting to widen a passage to follow other cavers. Another
involved digging for new cave, which was also a source of
some near misses.
A fatal incident at Big Four Ice Caves, Washington,
involved falling ice. Rockfall may have also been involved in
the 1997 fatality in Fern Cave, Alabama, by causing an out-of-
control rappel. Rockfall also accounts for several of the "near-
miss" incidents.
Stuck
Despite popular perception, getting stuck is not much of a
hazard in caving. There were, however, two rescue operations
involving stuck cavers: one in Fault Cave, Colorado, in 1997
and a serious incident in 1998 at Keyhole Cave, New York, in
which a major rescue was required to help a caver stuck in a
crevice. There were also several incidents involving cavers
who were temporarily stuck but managed to free themselves
with some help from companions.
Trapped/Stranded
This category is used to describe incidents in which the
caver or cavers are prevented from exiting the cave by
rockfall, light failure, lack of equipment, equipment failure, or
other causes. In many of the reported incidents, "spelunkers"
became stranded due to inexperience, inadequate equipment
and/or poor judgment.
Incidents in this issue include: entrapments by flooding,
rockfall, and caver-induced passage collapse; falling down
pits and sinkholes; key broken off in gate lock; a swimmer
washed into a sea cave; and the old standby, rappelling into
pits without ascending gear. One incident was fatal - the death
by drowning or hypothermia of the man who rappelled into a
flooded pit without ascending gear.
Exhaustion
There were four incidents in 1996 and one each in 1997
and 1998 in which cavers became too exhausted to exit and
required assistance. Several of these incidents involved cavers
who became exhausted while climbing, either on rope or on
cable ladders. This type of incident is potentially fatal due to
the rapid onset of "harness induced pathology."
A French study in 1984 and another in 1991 showed that
an immobile caver hanging on rope can lose consciousness in
a matter of minutes, with death occurring soon after.
Competent vertical cavers should be able to perform a
changeover to rappel and get off rope within a few minutes.
Difficulty on Rope or Ladder
There were six incidents in 1996, five in 1997, and one in
1998 in which cavers encountered serious difficulty on rappel
or ascent. Most of these involved problems on ascent, and
several involved the use of cable ladders on short drops.
Many of the cavers involved were inexperienced and did
not know how to use their gear. Some were unable to deal
with situations such as crossing the lip of a pit with weight on
the rope from below, changing from rappel to ascent and vice
versa, or climbing a cable ladder. It should go without saying
that competent cavers master their systems and know how
their equipment works. Practice makes perfect, as they say.
Climbing a cable ladder is not as easy as it sounds. Several
incidents involved the use of a cable ladder without a belay.
Two serious injuries resulted from this dangerous practice.
Many U.S. cavers prefer to stick with SRT.
Other
This catch-all category includes: bumped heads with
suspected neck injuries; an abrasion that developed a
staphylococcus infection requiring hospitalization; a
methamphetamine lab found in a cave; an in-cave bear
encounter; a tree falling into a pit while cavers were on rope;
and an animal trap encountered in a cave entrance.
Caving-related or Outside Incidents
There were seven reported caving-related incidents from
1996 through 1998. One involved individuals who descended
a mine shaft with no ascending gear, another was a drowning
which occurred on the hike back from a cave, and a third was
an ATV accident en-route to a cave. Four involved bodies
found in a cave or something described as a cave. These
incidents are not included in the regular accident totals.
Cave Diving Incidents
There were two reported cave diving incidents for 1996.
Both involved fatalities. The first occurred at Paradise
Springs, Florida, and involved open-water divers who did not
follow standard cave diving safety rules. One diver died when
he silted out the water and did not have a guideline. The other
involved an open water diver who was found dead in a sea
cave. He was diving without a partner, and the circumstances
of his death were unknown.
The two reported incidents for 1997 also involved
fatalities. A fatality at Four Sharks Blue Hole in the Bahamas
was attributed to nitrogen narcosis. The second incident
involved a diver believed to have suffered an embolism or a
heart attack while diving in Jackson Blue Spring, Florida. In
1998 there was only one reported incident - a case of
decompression sickness ("the bends") during the Wakulla 2
expedition in Florida.

More on Bad Air in Caves
William Mixon
Bill Elliott's discussion of "bad air" in caves in the last
issue of American Caving Accidents does not, I think, make
very clear the distinction between too little oxygen (O2) and
too much carbon dioxide (CO2). The confusion is natural as
far as cave environments are concerned, because usually a
percentage of CO2 derives from the consumption of an equal
percentage of O2 during decomposition of material washed
into the cave. For the same reason, the confusion is not
particularly dangerous. However, those breathing artificial
mixtures of gases, such as cave divers, need to know the
difference, and there may be cases in nature, such as where
volcanic gases are seeping into caves, where CO2 appears
without a matching O2 deficit.
A considerable deficit of O2, even down from the normal
21 percent of air to 10 percent, is not usually dangerous if the
missing oxygen has been replaced by some harmless gas such
as nitrogen or helium. What really matters is the actual density
of O2, called partial pressure in this context, which is a
function of both percentage of O2 and air pressure. At sea
level, if the percentage of O2 in the air is 21, then the partial
pressure of O2 is .21 atmospheres. At twelve thousand feet,
because of the reduced air pressure, 21 percent O2 gives a
partial pressure of only about .13 atmospheres. That would
also be the O2 partial pressure at sea level if the percentage of
O2 were only 13.
So 13 percent O2 at sea level has about the same effect as
being at twelve thousand feet, assuming that the missing
oxygen at sea level has not been replaced by something that is
itself dangerous. Prolonged exposure would give an
unacclimated individual some symptoms of mountain
sickness, and his athletic ability would be somewhat impaired,
but it would hardly be dangerous. Even Mt. Everest, at the top
of which the partial pressure of oxygen is far below .10
atmospheres, has been climbed without supplemental oxygen.
The article in Underwater Speleology, volume 22, number 1,
that was cited in the last American Caving Accidents in
connection with the analysis of Ian Rolland's cave diving
accident contains a good discussion of hypoxia and a number
of references.
On the other hand, a significant percentage of CO2 will be
dangerous, whether or not there is an accompanying deficit of
oxygen. Too much CO2 is dangerous because the partial
pressure of CO2 in your venous blood is about .07
atmospheres, which means it would be in equilibrium with air
with seven percent CO2 at sea level. At such a concentration,
therefore, your body would not be able to get rid of CO2 by
outgassing it into the air in your lungs. Hence the problem

Speleological Society.

with excess CO2 depends on the difference between the
concentration in the air and seven percent (with appropriate
adjustments for higher elevations, where in fact a higher
percentage of CO2 could be tolerated because the partial
pressure will be lower than the percentage in the air). This
explains why a concentration of three percent CO2 in air, a
hundred times normal, is somewhat tolerable, whereas a
further increase by a factor of only two, to six percent, results
in an urgent problem. At three percent, you've lost less than
half your ability to get rid of CO2 generated in your body; at
six percent you've lost roughly 85 percent of it.
A mixture such as 14 percent oxygen, seven percent
carbon dioxide, and the rest nitrogen, such as might be found
in a cave with very bad air, is dangerous because of the excess
of CO2, not the deficit of oxygen. A mixture of 90 percent
oxygen and ten percent CO2 would be deadly, whereas a
mixture of 90 percent nitrogen and ten percent oxygen would
not be. Of course, neither of the latter two mixtures is going to
be encountered in a cave.
Near-normal oxygen concentration is used as an indicator
of good air in industrial situations because solid-state oxygen
sensors are available and because a deficit of oxygen implies
that something is wrong with the air, and when safety is
concerned, it doesn't matter much what. Where I used to work,
the problem would have been SF6, not CO2. I suspect that the
threshold of 19.5 percent oxygen that Bill Elliott mentioned as
the OSHA limit is mainly based on the expected precision of
the oxygen meters.
Butane cigarette lighters or carbide lamp flames are often
mentioned as indicators of bad air in caves. It is true that due
to some combination of the deficit of oxygen and the excess
of CO2, their flames do burn in subtly different ways when the
air is bad. But they will continue to burn in air that you can't
breathe. A better indicator is a candle, which will not burn in
significantly bad air. I think that is because the flame will not
burn hotly enough to melt wax to feed the candle flame,
which, although it can be started, will promptly go out. The
melting point of candle wax is carefully calibrated to give the
desired size of flame in normal air. Unfortunately, a candle
will fail to burn in cave air in which you can still cave, with a
lot of huffing and puffing, SO it may be a bit too conservative,
if safe, as a practical indicator. Most cavers have figured out
that a candle is not very usable as a practical emergency
source of light for moving through a cave, but they might still
carry one as a good source of warmth, especially for an
electric caver. Verifying a suspicion of bad air is another use
for a candle.

Previously Unreported Incident

********** 1 April 1995
Emergency Cave, Maryland
trapped, inadequate clothing
Jess Kitting (24) and twelve Girl Scouts entered
Emergency Cave, expecting to go caving. They descended the
five drops (21, 55, 75, 53, 131, and 45 feet) and proceeded to
the Lost Idiots Section, where the group encountered a group
of Boy Scouts of about the same age and social standing. The
Scouts had descended the pits using the corkscrew attachment
to their Swiss army knives and were now stuck at the bottom.
They erroneously believed that the can opener attachment
could be used as an ascender to climb the pits. They were also
concerned that Les Liechly, their leader, might have trouble
using his Hand-Over-Hand system due to the need to raise his
arms. Indeed, during practice he had a lot of difficulty trying
to use the system, but they decided to take him on the trip
anyway. Liechly had spent two days mostly sleeping in a car
parked nearby. He had driven his Land Cruiser to the bottom
of the fifth drop and tied his haul rope to it.
Kitting went to check Liechly's condition. He felt at that
point that he should stay in the car. The Scouts, meanwhile,
decided to split into teams of two and proceeded to the
Secluded Section. When Kitting caught up later, she noticed
the Scouts were having trouble keeping their lamps going. A
short distance further she came upon what appeared to be a
clump of fur and a homemade pipe bomb. Many Scouts
showed signs of labored breathing, rapid heartbeat, and
inadequate clothing. Suspecting bad air, Kitting lit a
disposable lighter. The lighter burned normally, but Kitting
thought that the air in the small passage was "definitely
getting funky" and decided to exit the cave at once.
At the first climb, Kitting's pants jammed on duct tape.
After twenty minutes of struggling out of her pants, she freed
herself and fell, striking the wall several times along the way
and losing her underwear following an impact close to her
bottom. A slab of limestone 50 feet long and 20 feet wide and
about six inches thick fell from the ceiling, pinning Kitting's
underwear to the ground. Initial attempts by the Scouts to get
Kitting on a stretcher and then a backboard were not
successful. They tried to burn her T-shirt for warmth. A
problem arose when it was discovered that Kitting had been
carrying a semi-automatic pistol concealed in a shoulder
holster, and was threatening to shoot the first Scout that
touched her. There was a lot of discussion about letting her
climb out on her own power.
Kitting decided to exit the lower entrance and left,
crawling backwards. In the Very Confusing Section, Kitting
encountered two cavers who had been sent to call for help in
the 1992 issue of American Caving Accidents and had become
lost. At the lower entrance she found the passage flooded.
Outside, a sudden ray of sunshine had melted all the snow,
and the water had backed up behind a snowmobile blocking
the passage. Kitting tried to swim the pool, but a bag full of
heavy, unnecessary gear she was carrying was not buoyant as
expected. Fortunately, she found a surfboard floating among
the dead SCUBA divers, and was able to exit. Meanwhile, the
Scouts were attempting to light a 55-gallon gasoline lantern.
This caused a "geyser like" explosion, opening another 35 by
40 foot sinkhole in the middle of Maryland State Route 31 in
Carroll County.

Comments: Many Girl Scouts reported inexperience and
inadequate equipment. Kitting was fortunate to have found a
surfboard, since these are not normally found in caves. Cavers
should consider including one in their packs. Pants are
generally a good idea, though some cavers refuse to wear
them. Also, her underwear had an elastic waistband. Better
caving underwear with an inelastic quick-release waistband
would remain on. The quality of the underwear makes a
statement about the value the wearer places on the contents.

1996 Accident and Incident Reports
Winter 1996
Ellisons Cave, Georgia
rockfall, lost control of rappel
Alan Barnette and three companions were descending the
multi-drop route near Fantastic Pit. While rappelling the third
drop, 270 feet, Barnette was struck on the back of the neck by
a rock that became detached from the wall and fell. Stunned
by the impact, he lost control of his rappel and fell the
remaining 30 feet to the floor, landing on his large backpack.
Barnette was stunned, but quickly recovered. He used a
radio to let the others know what had happened. They re-
rigged the rope in a better location and descended. After a
brief conference, they decided to leave the cave.
Alabama Underground, Jan/Feb/Mar 1996, v4n1, p. 2.
Comments: Some of the impact was absorbed by the
backpack, which may have served to cushion his landing. A
prusik knot or similar device placed below the rappel rack can
serve as a safety against this type of incident. The risk of
rockfall is always present, and the first one to descend is at
particular risk. The report also notes that the cavers forgot to
tie a knot in the end of the rope before lowering it, SO Barnette
was proceeding cautiously. It might have been better to pull
the rope back up and tie the knot first.


********** 5 January
Log Cave, Alabama
flooding, difficulty on rope
David Drake and six other cavers entered Log Cave on a
cold, wet Saturday morning on a trip sponsored by the
Cullman Grotto. The entrance was taking in more water than
usual due to several days of rainy weather. Crawling along the
right side to stay out of the water, they followed the stream for
200 feet until it disappeared into a 30-foot pit. They rigged a
rope and descended the pit, managing to avoid most of the
water.
At the bottom, they followed the stream down a section of
passage known as the Sewer. Drake noted the presence of logs
and debris jammed into the ceiling above the stream,
indicating that the passage sometimes floods completely. They
spent some time touring the rooms and formation areas
downstream.
When they returned to the pit, they were surprised to find
that the water level had increased dramatically. They were
concerned that the entrance passage above the waterfall might
be flooded or that they would be unable to make the climb in
the waterfall. Two of the cavers had never climbed a rope
before. They considered returning to a dry room to wait for
the water to subside.
After some reluctance, one caver got on rope and climbed
through the icy water to the top and reported that the passage
was not flooded. The remaining cavers then climbed out,
though not without some difficulty. One caver had to be
pulled over the lip. They exited to sunny skies without further
incident.
3. David Drake, "Waterlogged, Cullman Grotto Flowstone,
February 1996.
4. David Drake, Incident report, February 1996.
Comments: Drake notes that they expected wet conditions,
but got a bit more than they bargained for. Based on the
weather forecast and his previous experience with the cave, he
felt it was safe to enter. In an accompanying editorial, he
writes that the general public sometimes unfairly criticizes
caving as "crazy, stupid, and dangerous." He then notes that
"maybe, just maybe, this time it was justified."


********** 11 February
Weatherly Well, Tennessee
entrapment by tight entrance
James Lewis, Alan England (63) and Darrell Moore, all
experienced cavers, accompanied Jerry Olson to a new cave
Olson had located while ridgewalking. The entrance was a
tight nine-inch wide slot leading in four feet and then
dropping about seven feet to larger passage and another ten-
foot drop. England was the only one who could fit through the
slot, SO he entered, using a rope as a handline. He noticed that
the slot was quite tight, but had little trouble getting through.
Using the same rope, he descended the second drop and found
a small passage and additional drops requiring rope. Because
he was alone, he decided not to go any further, and began his
exit.
The ten-foot drop was easily climbed, but the entrance
drop proved to be a problem. Despite all efforts and assistance
from the cavers outside, he was unable to squeeze back up
through the tight slot. Apparently, his relaxed posture and
assistance from gravity had made entry much easier than the
exit. After spending about 45 minutes trying to get through,
England was tired and cold. The wet rock in the entrance had
soaked his clothing, and the cold winter conditions were
inducing hypothermia. After discussing their options, the
cavers decide to call for assistance.
Lewis and Olson hiked back to Olson's house and called
the East Tennessee Cave Rescue team. Rescuers reached the
cave about two hours after the call. England had been resting,
and had been given extra clothing and some warm food and
drink to combat hypothermia. Using various rigging and
hauling techniques, rescuers were able to free England after
about an hour's work. He was able to walk back to the car
without further assistance.
James Lewis, Victor Johnson, and Alan England, Incident
report, undated.
Comments: England notes that he had a "gravity assist"
getting in, and did not appreciate how difficult it could be to
get back out. The tight slot hampered his ability to operate his
ascenders, and made it difficult for anyone to help him. He
was in the cave for five hours.

1996 Accident and Incident Reports


********** 17 February
Langdons Cave, Indiana
caver fall, inadequate equipment
Paul Copple (37), Tony Ballard (32), and David Welch
(30) entered Langdons Cave at about 2:00 a.m. Saturday
morning to go caving. The men had been in the cave before,
but had always stopped at the first pit. This time, Ballard
wanted to descend the pit and go deeper into the cave. At
about 3:15 a.m. he attempted to descend, but slipped and fell
about 40 feet to the bottom, injuring his back. Copple
attempted to descend to help him, but the small-diameter cord
he was using broke and he fell into the pit, fracturing his ribs.
Welch left the cave to call for help.
Personnel from the Department of Natural Resources and
local fire and rescue teams responded, and were able to get the
two men up the pit and out of the cave by 10:00 a.m.
Saturday. Both men were hypothermic, and Ballard was in and
out of consciousness. Ballard was flown by helicopter to the
hospital, and Copple was transferred by ambulance.
1. Christi Poole "2 men hurt, trapped by fall in cave,"
Louisville Courier-Journal, 18 February 1996, p. B-3.
2. Bruce Bowman, Personal communications, undated.
Comments: The men were not experienced cavers and
were not using proper caving rope and equipment. It was
reported that alcohol was a factor, and that the reason for the
late night trip was that they had to sneak out to avoid spousal
opposition. It was also reported that the rescuers were not
trained in cave rescue, and cavers were not called in until late
in the operation.


********** 20 February
Fisher Ridge Cave, Kentucky
flood entrapment
Peter Quick, Brian Davis, Joe Meppelink, Eric Fehlauer,
and Leigh Ann Vaughn of the Detroit Urban Grotto entered
Fisher Ridge Cave on Saturday, February 17, on an
exploration and survey expedition. The area to be surveyed
was very remote from the entrance, SO they carried supplies
for a four-day underground camp. They planned to leave the
cave on Tuesday, February 20.
The route to their camp passed through a crawl which
sometimes fills with water after a rain, taking several days to
drain. They found the passage open, and proceeded to their
destination without incident. After establishing camp, they
began their survey. Sometime later, they noticed that the flow
volume of the water source near the camp had increased
dramatically.
They realized that this indicated rain on the surface, and
surmised that the low crawl would probably be flooded,
preventing their exit. This turned out to be correct. They
decided to move their camp forward to a dry area near the
flooded crawl and wait for the water to drain. While waiting,
they retrieved food and supplies from caches placed in the
cave during earlier expeditions against the possibility of just
such an occurrence. They settled in to wait for the water to
subside, checking the level in the crawlway approximately
every 12 hours.
When the cavers failed to return home by Wednesday,
family members became concerned and contacted other cavers
from the grotto. Steve Miller and Larry Bean, who were
familiar with the cave, volunteered to drive from Michigan
down to the cave and check on the overdue group. Local
emergency services agencies were also alerted, as well as cave
rescue teams in the region.
By the time Miller and Bean reached the flooded crawlway
on Thursday afternoon, the water had begun to subside and
they could hear Quick digging a trench to help drain the
crawl. They made voice contact, and Quick realized that there
was enough airspace to squeeze through. The cavers made
their way through the crawl and exited the cave in good
condition on Thursday evening, February 22, after six days
underground.
1. Cynthia Eagles, "Cavers trapped by water safely out,"
Louisville Courier-Journal, 32 February 1996, p. A-1.
2. Mike Summers, Incident report, 23 February 1996.
Comments: The report notes that the cavers knew from
experience that the crawl was prone to flooding, but were
unaware that rain was in the forecast for the weekend. It pays
to know that sort of information.
They were prepared for a long stay and had extra supplies
available, SO the situation was not as difficult as it might have
been. In such cases, it is sufficient to wait for the water to
subside. This can be difficult to convey to the assembled
media and non-caving emergency services personnel who are
compelled by law and custom to respond. See the 30
November 1996 report for a familiar story.


********** 26 February
Flower Pot Cave, West Virginia
caver fall, descending hand-over-hand
A group of eight people, equipped with bicycle lights,
helmets, and a knotted rope obtained permission and entered
Flower Pot Cave, descending the 38-foot entrance pit hand-
over-hand. While attempting to climb out, Thomas Malloy
(42) lost his grip and fell about 20 feet to the bottom, breaking
several ribs. Local fire and rescue services were called, and
Malloy was placed in a litter and hauled up the pit. He was
transported to a local hospital for treatment.

Comments: Inexperience, inadequate equipment, and poor
judgement. They did not have proper rappelling and climbing
equipment. The hand-over-hand "technique" is a prescription
for disaster. Malloy was lucky - a 20-foot fall can be fatal.

February
Neversink Pit, Alabama
difficulty on rope, stuck at lip
Three individuals rappelled into 160-foot-deep Neversink
Pit. Two of them had never rappelled or climbed rope before.
They attempted to climb out using prusik knots with all three
climbers on rope at the same time. They became stranded
when the first one up was unable to get over the lip due to the
weight of his fellow climbers on rope below him.
The two below backed down and got off rope, but the
stranded climber was still unable to get over the lip. They
were saved when a local caver and cave rescue team member
showed up to do the pit and found them hanging. He rigged an
ascender above the lip and helped the stranded caver up. The
others then climbed out under their own power.
Buddy Lane, Incident report, 2 March 1996.
Comments: A 160-foot pit is probably not the best place to
try rappelling and prusiking for the first time. Many cavers
carry an extra ascender to aid in crossing difficult lips. The lip
at this pit is not difficult, and the incident was caused by
inexperience and poor technique. Three people on-rope
simultaneously is not a good idea.
February
Thunder Canyon Cave, California
stuck in crevice, exhaustion
Carl Diaz and eight other cavers from the San Diego and
Southern California Grottos entered Thunder Canyon Cave in
two groups. Diaz and five other cavers planned to make a
through-trip from the upper entrance to the lower entrance,
negotiating four drops (45 feet, 45 feet, 10 feet, and 20 feet)
and a tight traverse to emerge at the lower entrance. The
traverse is described as 15 feet long, with a "tapered
bottomless floor," and very tight. Conditions in the cave were
wet and cool, with waterfalls at the drops. The remaining three
planned to tour the upper cave, examine the rigging points for
the drops, and leave early through the middle entrance.
The larger group proceeded through the cave without
incident, exiting after three hours of caving. Diaz volunteered
to go back in through the middle entrance and retrieve the
rope left at the second drop. When he arrived at the drop, he
saw that the rigging had been changed, and concluded that the
second group had continued on to the bottom and would leave
via the lower entrance. He removed the rope and left the cave.
When he rejoined the group outside and discovered that
the second group had not yet emerged, Diaz became
concerned. He hiked down to the lower entrance, where he
found that one of the three cavers had slid down into the
crevice and become wedged mid-way through. The other two
were unable to help him back up and through the tight spot.
Diaz ran back to the first group and sent them down to assist.
He then returned to the middle entrance, re-rigged the rope,
and descended through the cave to the start of the traverse. By
the time he arrived, the cavers had managed to use carabiners
and other equipment to fashion a chockstone in the crack
above the trapped caver. Webbing hung from the chockstone
served as foot loops and allowed the caver to pull himself up
and back out of the crack.
Diaz then escorted the now exhausted caver back through
the cave, up three pits, and out the middle entrance. They
exited about two and a half hours after the caver had become
stuck.
Carl Diaz, "Rescue - Thunder Canyon,' San Diego Grotto
Newsletter, March 1996.
Comments: Diaz notes that the caver had not been to the
cave before, weighed about 215 pounds, and admitted to being
out of shape. He suggests being prepared for this type of
incident with some 20-foot lengths of webbing or a handline,
and perhaps some chocks or other removable climbing
anchors. He also notes that it was probably not a good idea to
de-rig the cave without knowing the plans and condition of
the other group.
Cavers wedged in a crevice can quickly become
hypothermic. There have been fatalities from such incidents. It
can be very difficult to extract even a conscious caver from a
tight crevice.


********** 17 March
Sycamore Cave, Alabama
caver fall, ascending hand-over-hand
Eddie Taylor (22) and three companions entered Sycamore
Cave around 3:00 p.m. on a Saturday afternoon. They used a
knotted 150-foot rope to descend a 110-foot pit in the cave.
When he tried to climb out, Taylor lost his grip and fell about
35 feet to the floor. He suffered bruises and a possible
fractured pelvis.
Two of his companions left the cave and called for help at
7:30 p.m. Local rescue squads and a cave rescue team from
nearby Huntsville responded. Taylor was placed in a litter,
hauled up the pit, and carried out of the cave, reaching the
surface at 3:15 a.m. He was taken to a hospital, where he was
treated and released.

Needless to say, this dangerous and unsafe method is not
recommended. Still, there are several such incidents every
year.


********** 21 March
Fault Cave, Colorado
stuck
Randy Winans and companions were exploring Fault Cave
near Denver when one caver became wedged head-down in a
tight slot known as the Crack of Doom. His efforts to get out
only made the entrapment worse. When they were unable to
free him, his companions decided to call for help. Winans left
the cave and used his cellular phone to call local caver Jim

Neely, requesting that Neely notify the Sheriff and round up
some other cavers to come help.
Neely did as requested and arrived at the cave to find a
full-scale rescue in progress. Cavers and local firefighters
were already in the cave working to free the trapped caver.
They removed some of his clothing, coated him with vaseline,
and eventually managed to pull him from the crack. He was
able to exit the cave and hike down the mountain without
further assistance.

Comments: The trapped caver was on his very first caving
trip. It must have been quite memorable.

********** 7 April
unnamed pit in Guatemala
caver fall
Scott Sievertsen was in Guatemala with several other
cavers on an expedition to find, explore, and survey new
caves. In the second week of the expedition, the cavers
decided to investigate a small pit near the campsite. After
clearing loose rocks, Sievertsen rappelled the 40-foot entrance
pit, clearing more loose rock during the descent.
At the bottom he found several leads to check. He stepped
up onto a boulder to look into the largest side passage. As he
leaned forward to look into the passage, the rock he was using
for a handhold came loose. Sievertsen lost his balance and
tumbled into the passage, along with the loose rock. He
bounced off the walls and landed on the floor after falling
eight to 12 feet. The "handhold" rock then struck him on the
right arm and lower back. He felt pain in his arm and lower
back. He was able to climb back up and exit the cave without
assistance.
Upon returning to camp, he discovered that he had a
serious laceration on his left shin, with some exposure of the
bone. The nerves near the wound had apparently been
damaged, and he felt no pain from the injury. It was cleaned,
treated with antibiotics, and bandaged. He then made an eight-
hour drive to the nearest medical facility, where the wound
was sutured the next day.

with Forrest, The Valley Caver, Fall 1996, v35n3, p. 22.
2. Scott Sievertsen, Personal communication, 1 May 1998.
Comments: Sievertsen notes that while he was already an
accomplished caver at the time, he had limited experience
exploring virgin cave. He feels that this was a significant
factor in the accident. Loose rock and unreliable holds are
much more common in unexplored caves than in caves which
have seen some traffic. Sievertsen advises cavers to use extra
caution when exploring virgin cave.


********** 27 April
Buckners Cave, Indiana
caver fall, intoxication
An intoxicated individual fell in the cave and suffered a
head injury. Rescuers were summoned, but arrived just as the
injured party reached the entrance under his own power. No
additional information was available.
Jim Johnson, Incident report, undated.


********** 11 May
Midnight Creek Cave, California
caver fall, trapped under water
Richard Breisch, Collin O'Neill, Curt Wexel, and Renee
Van Vreeswyk were part of a group of 11 visiting Midnight
Creek Cave. The cave had been closed since 1994 by the
government agency responsible for its management due to
high levels of hydrogen sulfide in the water. The group was
comprised of cavers and government safety experts, and the
purpose of the trip was to test for the presence of dangerous
gases or other conditions.
The party split into two groups, touring the cave without
incident until they reached the upstream end and began their
exit. Breisch was leading the trailing group, which included
O'Neill, Wexel, and Van Vreeswyk, when he stepped on a
slippery rock and fell down a three-foot diameter vertical
chute in the stream. He landed in a standing position, but was
wedged in the chute with his head below the water surface.
Breisch was not sure if he was at the bottom of the chute,
and was afraid to move for fear of falling farther down. He
also did not know how close the rest of the group was behind
him and whether anyone had seen him fall. By bending
forward he managed to create an air pocket which allowed
him to breathe.
As he reached forward to see if he could chimney out of
the water, Breisch felt someone land on top of him, forcing
him down. O'Neill had seen the fall and reached in to help,
but slipped and fell in himself. O'Neill called for help, and
Van Vreeswyk was able to help him climb back out. Wexel
then arrived, and the three were able to pull Breisch out of the
chute as he pushed from below.

---------- Page 17 ----------
1996 Accident and Incident Reports
Once clear of the stream, Breisch found that he was
unharmed. He had, however, lost his carbide lamp and
prescription eyeglasses. He put on a wetsuit top that Wexel
had in his pack, and they started out of the cave. The trip out
took longer than normal because Breisch could not see well
without his glasses, and was the only one in the group familiar
with the cave.
1. Richard Breisch, "Incident in Midnight Creek Cave, San
Diego Grotto Newsletter, June 1996.
2. Collin O'Neill, "Caving Accident Report, San Diego
Grotto Newsletter, June 1996.
Comments: Breisch notes that the quick actions of his
companions saved him from drowning. He felt that had he
been alone he would not have been able to climb back out of
the chute due to the heavy water volume. O'Neill notes that in
his haste to help Breisch, he did not fully evaluate the danger
of the chute and wound up becoming its second victim.
O'Neill also observes that a spare pair of glasses would have
been a good idea.


********** 29 May
Great Cavern, Idaho
caver fall, inadequate equipment
An 18-year-old male was injured while attempting to rock-
climb out of the vertical entrance of Great Cavern. The victim
and his companions were attempting to gain entrance into the
closed portion of nearby Crystal Ice Cave; a former
commercial cave now closed and abandoned.
The victim was the first to rappel into the cave, and
quickly realized that he was beyond his abilities. He attempted
to climb the walls of the pit while his brother belayed him
from above. The belay was not in line with the climber's
route. He lost his grip on the rotten rock and swung across the
pit, striking the far wall and breaking his ankle.
His two companions were unable to haul him up, SO they
called for help. The county search and rescue team responded,
and hauled the injured climber out of the pit. His father
arrived during the rescue, and took him to the hospital for
treatment.
Scott Earl, Incident report, 1 October 1996.
Comments: The cave has been the scene of several other
accidents, including one fatality. The boys believed that the pit
led into Crystal Ice Cave.
May
Cave Mountain Cave, Arkansas
lost, stranded, inadequate equipment
Seven individuals from Clarksville entered Cave Mountain
Cave at about 3:00 p.m. They were dressed in shorts and T-
shirts and carried flashlights. They did not have helmets or
other proper caving equipment. Four members of the group
left the cave after about an hour. Two others exited shortly
thereafter. The remaining individual was last seen entering a
difficult and challenging section of the cave, which included
some danger of falling.
After waiting for some time, the others re-entered the cave
to search for the missing individual. They returned to the
place where he had last been seen, but did not find him. After
searching for some time, they left the cave and called for help
shortly after 9:00 p.m.
Search teams entered the cave at 11:00 p.m. The initial
search effort failed to locate the lost person. Search patterns
were revised, and another sweep of the cave was made. At
2:50 a.m. searchers made voice contact with the lost person,
but were unable to reach him until 3:45 a.m. He appeared to
be suffering from hypothermia, and had difficulty speaking or
moving. Rescuers warmed him and gave him some food, then
helped him out of the cave, reaching the surface at 4:55 a.m.
He was transported to a hospital for treatment of advanced
hypothermia.

2. Boston Mountain Underground, Fall 1996, v8n3, p. 6,
reprint of Times article.
Comments: The missing caver had become lost, wandering
the cave until his flashlight went out, leaving him stranded. He
had no backup lights. He spent about ten hours sitting in the
dark, cold and wet, wearing cotton shorts and a T-shirt, and
became hypothermic. The report notes that the lost caver did
several things wrong: he left the group, was improperly
dressed for the conditions, and was without adequate sources
of light. The entire group was ill equipped and unprepared for
the cave. The report advises would-be cavers to join a grotto
and get proper training and equipment.
May
Samwell Cave, California
stranded, inadequate equipment
Michael Richison (26) and Jeff Leeka (23) became
stranded while exploring Samwell cave when they were
unable to climb back up the ropes they had used to enter the
cave. They were rescued by the Shasta County Mountain
Rescue team, and were reported to be cold but otherwise
unharmed.
Shasta Lake Bulletin, 8 May 1998, p. 1.
Comments: The men descended hand-over-hand, and
could not climb back up the wet ropes. They did not have
proper equipment for vertical caving.

Lick Creek Cave, Montana
lost, stranded, inadequate equipment
Jim Turton, Bob Furman, and Rodney Van Hoyt left Great
Falls at about 2:30 p.m. to go caving, planning to return by
10:00 p.m. Instead, they spent 40 hours shivering in the dark
after their lights went out, leaving them stranded. They feared
that they would not get out alive. At some point, Van Hoyt
suffered an epileptic seizure and nearly fell into a crevice.
Van Hoyt's wife became worried when he did not return
by Sunday, and drove to the cave, where she found their

pickup truck but not the three men. She alerted authorities
early Monday morning, and the mountain search and rescue
team was dispatched to search the cave.
The three men were soon found, and were brought out of
the cave about 8:20 a.m. Monday morning. Van Hoyt was
treated for hypothermia. The others were uninjured.
"Great Falls men get lost in Lick Creek Cave," Bozeman
Daily Chronicle, 7 June 1996, p. 5.
Comments: Several factors including inadequate equip-
ment, inexperience, and poor judgement contributed to this
incident. Experienced cavers carry three sources of light per
person. Each light should be good enough to permit a safe
exit.


********** 2 June
Small Cave, Alabama
difficulty on rope, equipment problem
Tom Moss was on rope climbing a 35-foot pit in Small
Cave when the main buckle on his seat harness came undone,
dropping him two to three inches before his leg loops caught
the weight. He had neglected to properly fasten the buckle by
feeding the webbing back through a second time. He knew the
buckle was the double-pass kind, but was wearing the harness
over a bulky wetsuit, and there was not enough webbing left
for the second pass. Moss was able to swing over onto a ledge
and fasten the buckle before continuing.
Tom Moss, Incident report, 6 November 1996.
Comments: Moss notes that he had recently ordered a
larger seat harness especially for use with the wet suit, but that
it had not come in yet. Harness buckles can easily come
undone if not property secured. He was fortunate that the
harness was the type with independent leg loops. With some
designs, failure of the main buckle causes complete failure of
the harness.


********** 15 June
Belle Cave, Arkansas
rockfall
Rob Tayloe was leading a group of cavers on a tour trip
when they came to a 30-foot climb-up about 1.5 miles into the
cave. The first caver started up, and a second caver (female,
age 22) followed before the first caver had reached the top.
The others did not notice that the second climber had started
before the climb was clear. The lead caver dislodged a rock,
which fell and struck the second caver on the hand, causing
injury to three fingers.
There were serious lacerations and some exposure of the
bone. The cavers fashioned a makeshift bandage from some
clothing and a piece of webbing. They made their way out of
the cave, carrying the injured caver's pack, and drove to the
nearest hospital. There, the wound was cleaned, sutured, and
dressed.
Rob Tayloe, Incident report, 14 October 1996.
Comments: Tayloe observes that the accident could easily
have been avoided by waiting until the climb was clear before
following. He notes that, as the trip leader, he should have
been paying more attention to this.

********** 29 June
Barrack-Zourie Cave, New York
bad air
Peter Haberland and six other cavers were working on a
dig near the upstream North Sump in Barrack-Zourie Cave,
using a "bucket brigade" technique to remove excavated
material from the 90-foot long tubular crawlway. Digging
went quickly at first, with full buckets being shoved out
continuously. Whenever the digger at the head of the line
became fatigued, they rotated the line. Soon, the time that
anyone could dig became shorter and shorter and the diggers
complained of lack of air.
When it was Haberland's turn, he noticed that his
breathing quickly became very labored. Apparently, there was
little exchange of air at the end of the tube, and their exertions
were filling it with carbon dioxide. He tried to keep digging,
but mild panic set in and he was forced to withdraw.
Eventually, no one wanted to return to the dig face. They left,
having made ten feet of progress for the day.

June
Bighorn Cave, Wyoming
difficulty on rope, stranded, exhaustion
Sam, Carl, Chris, Darren, and Eric entered Bighorn Cave
by rappelling the 80-foot entrance pit. They spent eight or
nine hours caving, then took turns climbing back up the
entrance drop. Chris was the last to climb, and had difficulty
as soon as he started. He was using a ropewalker system with
Gibbs ascenders, and could not get the rope to feed through
his system properly. He was out of practice with his climbing
gear, and was using a lot of energy but making little progress.
The others had reached the top, where they found the
weather cold, rainy, and windy. They put their equipment in
the truck, and Sam stayed at the pit to coach Chris while
Darren drove Carl and Eric back to camp. Darren was to
return later to pick up Sam and Chris.
While the others were gone, Chris had reached the halfway
point and become exhausted. He called up to Sam that he was
finished, and could go no further. He also called up to report
that his seat harness was coming undone. Sam advised him to

---------- Page 19 ----------
1996 Accident and Incident Reports
climb a little higher to a ledge where he could get his weight
off the rope, fix his harness, and rest. At that point Sam
regretted having let his climbing gear go back to camp. After
several attempts, Chris was able to get onto the ledge.
When Darren returned, he and Sam decided that Chris was
not going to make it out under his own power. They rigged a
simple haul system and pulled him up the remaining 40 feet of
the pit.
Sam Lair, "Climbing Incident at Bighorn Cave, Gem Caver,
Summer 1997, p. 4.
Comments: Sam notes that Chris was an experienced caver
and climber, but had not been caving for over ten years. He
suggests that Chris should have done some practice climbs in
a controlled environment to re-familiarize himself with his
equipment and abilities. He also notes that it was a mistake to
get separated from his own gear, which kept him from being
able to go down and help Chris or rig a haul system.
It is probably not a good idea to let a person of unknown
or lesser abilities climb last, or to leave the cave and go back
to camp before everyone is safely out, especially if you are
aware that someone is having difficulty. Caving is generally
regarded as a team endeavor.
Chris was fortunate that there was a ledge he could reach
to rest. Studies have shown that hanging immobile on rope in
a climbing harness can quickly lead to loss of consciousness
and possibly death. This condition is known as "harness hang
syndrome" or "harness induced pathology." An exhausted or
hypothermic climber is at serious risk. See the 1993 issue of
American Caving Accidents for a discussion of this issue.


********** 4 July
Laurel Caverns, Pennsylvania
struck head, suspected neck injury
Wendy (15) and Bonnie (15) were among 15 cavers
exploring the undeveloped portion of Laurel Caverns on a
church-sponsored youth group trip. They were accompanied
by an adult advisor, Mike Carick, and by two Laurel Caverns
employees, one of whom was Aaron Bird, an experienced
caver. As they approached Petit Falls shortly before 1:00 p.m.,
Wendy stood up too quickly and struck her head on the
ceiling, causing injury to her neck.
Bird sent the other employee and the rest of the group
back to summon help. They met John Chenger, Laurel
Caverns employee and experienced caver, and told him of the
accident. Chenger went to the scene, where Bird and Carick
had applied a SAM splint as a makeshift cervical collar to
stabilize Wendy's neck. They had learned that Wendy had
injured her neck in a skating accident some months earlier.
Chenger was sent to get equipment and personnel to carry her
out, while Bird and Carick waited with Wendy and treated her
to prevent hypothermia.
Chenger left the cave, flagging a trail back to the accident
site as he went. Once out, he gave instructions to summon
paramedics and additional cavers, then enlisted the aid of a
group of visiting boy scouts as well as members of Wendy's
original group. Several scouts and youth group cavers were
sent into the cave with a litter, initial response pack, and a
cervical collar to be delivered to Bird at the accident site.
Another group entered the cave to run field telephone line to
the accident site. The equipment was delivered and telephone
communications were soon established. Paramedics arrived
and were sent to the accident site.
Meanwhile, another injury had occurred. While holding a
light for rescuers working with Wendy, Bonnie slipped and
fell off a rock, injuring her hip. After assessment, she decided
she could walk out with assistance. She was accompanied out
of the cave and taken to the visitor's center, where she was
attended by paramedics.
Wendy was fitted with a cervical collar, placed in a litter,
and carried from the cave, exiting at 3:44 p.m. She was
transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital. Paramedics
treating Bonnie decided to transfer her by helicopter to a
hospital in Pittsburgh.
John Chenger, Incident report, NCRC Eastern Region web
site, undated.
Comments: The accident site was about 10 to 15 minutes
into the cave, not far from the tour trail. Several of the Laurel
caverns employees were experienced cavers with NCRC cave
rescue training. Rescue equipment, including the litter and
cervical collar, is stored on-site for such incidents - a good
idea for commercial cave operations. The use of untrained
personnel in a cave rescue may incur a greater risk of
additional injuries and complications.


********** 6 July
Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico
caver fall, lost control on rappel
Park employee Richard Houston (25) was adjusting a rope
pad at the top of the 40-foot entrance drop when he lost
control of his rappel device. He fell down the pit, sustaining
bruises and abrasions from the walls, and fell past the normal
spot for getting off rope and down an adjacent pit. The rope
was tied off in the room above, which saved Houston from
striking bottom by catching him in the dangling loop.
Harry Burgess, another park employee, was nearby and
heard the fall and Houston's call for help. Houston was able to
change over to ascent and climb up to the normal landing spot.
His hands were blistered underneath his thick leather gloves.
Burgess cleaned and dressed Houston's wounds, and Houston
climbed out of the pit on his own. Burgess also exited, and
Houston went to an emergency room for treatment.
Incident report, Carlsbad Caverns National Park, 6 July
1996.
Comments: The type of rappelling device used was not
specified in the report, but it is important to securely tie off
any rappelling device while working on rope pads or
performing other activities on rope. The method varies with
the device used. Do you know how to tie off your device of
choice? Also, you should have an ascender attached to your
harness that can be easily attached to the rope for backup.
Houston was very lucky that the pit continued and the rope
was tied off above.

unnamed boulder cave, California
fatality, stranded, inadequate equipment
Sam Meier (24) was rappelling near Hidden falls in
Yosemite National Park when he descended 125 feet into a
hole formed by boulders. The bottom of the hole was filled
with deep water. Meier had no ascending equipment and was
unable to climb back out. Officials believe that Meier
succumbed to hypothermia and drowned.
"Accidents kill two, injure one, San Diego Union-Tribune, 8
July 1996, p. A-3.
Comments: It should be obvious that it is unwise to rappel
into a pit without ascending equipment, but it happens all too
often. As experienced cavers, we may feel certain that we
would never do such a thing. But one can imagine a scenario
in which a caver loses his pack down a hole or pit, and is left
with no ascent gear and a pit to climb. A resourceful caver
should be able to fashion a workable harness and/or a set of
prusik knots from the tail end of his rope. It may not be a
model of comfort and efficiency, but it may be good enough
to get you out of a bad situation.


********** 7 July
Lockridge Aqua Cave, Virginia
caver fall
Jess Wilson (34) was part of a group of four experienced
cavers exploring Lockridge Aqua Cave on July 7. Entry into
the cave involves negotiating a five-foot deep pool with about
one foot of airspace. Most of the cave consists of large trunk
passage, with occasional wading or swimming.
About 15 minutes into the cave, the obvious route went
down under a pile of breakdown. Three members of the group
followed that route as Jess Wilson climbed the breakdown to
find an upper level passage. After about 100 feet, the upper
passage ended at a pit that dropped about 17 feet down into
the lower passage taken by the other cavers.
Wilson started to climb down. After he had descended five
feet, the other cavers warned him that the pit was undercut,
and suggested that he go back and take the easier way. Wilson
insisted that he could see a route to the bottom. Before
climbing down, he "tested" a potential foothold by kicking it.
Satisfied that it would hold, he stepped down onto the thin
ledge, which immediately broke, sending him to the bottom.
Wilson fell about 12 feet and landed upright on his right
heel. His knee was locked, and could not flex to absorb some
of the impact. As a result, he bit his tongue and chipped
several teeth.
After resting, he found that he could walk with moderate
pain. The group exited the cave in about 20 minutes. On the
drive home, his foot became swollen and more painful. The
following day he went to a hospital for X-rays and treatment.
The exam found no broken bones, and he was sent home on
crutches.
1. Jess Wilson, Incident report, undated.
2. Jess Wilson, "Good Times, Bad Times, Commander Cody

Comments: Wilson offers the following observations: "A
foothold that looks like it should be 'tested' should probably
be avoided. Jess was warned by his friends that the climb
looked difficult from below. Such climbs should use a belay.
The climb could be bypassed, and the safer option should be
used when one exists. Jess was lucky to be able to self-rescue,
because an immobilized patient would be difficult to move
through the near-sump at the entrance."


********** 13 July
Goochland Cave, Kentucky
caver fall, climbing without belay
David Bingham, Lee Trowbridge and four other cavers
were making an entrance-to-entrance through-trip in
Goochland Cave. They entered the cave at about 11:15 a.m.,
and were taking a little-known route to the Corn Hole
Entrance. About four hours into the trip they came to a ten-
foot climb-up, which was pre-rigged with a knotted rope for a
handline. Four members of the party ascended hand-over-hand
without incident. When Bingham made his ascent in the same
fashion, he reached the top but lost his footing at the lip and
fell. His body rotated during the fall SO that he landed on his
side, breaking his right femur near the hip.
Trowbridge helped Bingham move away from the drippy
climb, and get settled on a bed of extra clothing and pads.
They used a space blanket, hand warmer pouches, and extra
clothing left by the other cavers to combat hypothermia and
shock. Trowbridge then waited with Bingham while the others
went for help. The authorities were alerted and cavers with
rescue training were recruited from the nearby Karst-O-Rama
convention. A full-scale rescue involving more than 100
people was mobilized. The first rescuers reached Bingham
about four hours after his fall, and he was out of the cave
about 19 hours after his accident.

3. Jeff Cody, "Karst-O-Rama '96," Mid-Hoosier Grotto
Newsletter, October 1996, v4nl, p. 5.
Comments: The accident site was only about 800 feet from
the entrance, but the tight passage and small pits hindered the
rescue efforts. At one point Bingham had to be removed from
the Sked litter to make it through a "torturous" crawl.
Trowbridge suggests that the climb should have been belayed.
Bingham agrees, and notes that he felt uncomfortable about
making the climb hand-over-hand, but decided to do it
because the others had made it up without difficulty. He
writes, "Let me say this clearly and succinctly, a hand-over-
hand climb without a safety is an accident waiting to happen."
We agree.

acetylene hazard, chemical burn
Bill Hanson, Tom Moss, and two companions were on
their way out of Small Cave after a trip to the bottom of the

1996 Accident and Incident Reports
wet, multi-drop cave. Moss was dragging his pack behind him
on a tether as they made their way along a stream passage.
Moss picked up his pack and tossed it up onto a ledge five feet
off the floor and started to climb up. Suddenly, he realized
that he could smell acetylene, and that it was coming from his
pack. He and Hanson immediately doused their carbide lamps
to avoid igniting the gas.
Moss opened the pack and found that his carbide storage
bottle had leaked, and that water had flooded it. Expanding
gas had then ruptured the cap, allowing the carbide to spill out
into the flooded interior of the pack. He placed the bottle
inside a plastic bag, but could not seal it because the carbide
was still actively releasing gas. They switched to electric
lights and continued their exit.
Some time later, Moss became aware of pain at his right
wrist under the cuff of his wetsuit. He discovered that some
carbide had been trapped under the cuff when he had reached
into the pack earlier. He rinsed the area off, and found that he
had suffered a serious chemical burn. It was several weeks
before the burn healed.
Tom Moss, Incident report, 6 November 1996.
Comments: Moss notes that he now uses a stronger
Nalgene bottle for carbide storage.

ice fall
Two boys, ages 10 and 12, were on a YMCA outing to Big
Four Ice Caves when they were struck and injured by falling
ice. One boy received a cut on one leg, and the other a scraped
shoulder and leg. Both boys were able to walk out of the cave,
and were met in the parking lot by emergency services
personnel. They were taken to a local hospital where they
were treated and released
1. Seattle Times, 26 July 1996.
2. Mark Sherman, Incident report, 20 August 1996.
Comments: It was also reported that the boys were
throwing rocks at the ceiling just before the ice fell. Sherman
observes that this was "not exactly a smart thing to be doing in
an ice cave, especially after a week of temperatures in the high
80's and 90's."


********** 27 July
Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico
exhaustion, stranded in pit
At about 10:00 p.m. on Saturday evening Walter Feaster,
leader of an expedition to Lechuguilla Cave, informed NPS
personnel that a caver on the expedition was stranded and
unable to climb out of the entrance pit. Felder Hogan had
become exhausted and ill during the trip out of the cave and
did not feel he could climb out on his own. Park personnel
responded, reaching Hogan at about 11:30 p.m. He was
shivering and severely nauseated.
When it was determined that Hogan would have to be
hauled out, they sent for additional personnel and equipment.
By 1:30 a.m. the team was assembled and a haul system was
soon rigged at the pit. Hogan was on the surface by 3:30 a.m.
Incident report, Carlsbad Caverns National Park, 28 July
1996.
Comments: Lechuguilla is a very warm and strenuous
cave. Hogan had eaten two sandwiches at about 2:00 p.m. and
had some trail mix and beef jerky on the way out. Perhaps this
was not enough for the long trip out. He also may not have
taken in enough water. It is easy to become dehydrated in this
cave, and there have been quite a few similar situations in
which cavers have required assistance while exiting.
July
Big Mouth Cave, Arkansas
caver fall, climbing hand-over-hand
Three young men in their early 20's decided to enter the
cave by tying a hemp rope around a tree and sliding down the
30-foot entrance pit. They were equipped with flashlights, and
were not wearing helmets. Once on bottom they set out to
explore, but were stopped by water in the passage.
Two of the men exited, climbing back up the rope hand-
over-hand. The third man had some difficulty and made two
unsuccessful attempts. On his third attempt he was almost at
the top when he pinched one hand between the rope and the
wall, lost his grip, and fell approximately 20 feet. He suffered
fractures of his ankle and lower leg.
His companions summoned help, and local volunteer fire
department and emergency medical services personnel
responded. When authorities arrived at the scene, they decided
to call in the county search and rescue team, which includes
several cavers.
The victim was placed in a litter and hauled up the pit.
Several fire and EMS people had descended the pit without
climbing equipment and had to be hauled out as well. The
victim was airlifted to a hospital for treatment.

Comments: The hand-over-hand "technique" claims
another victim. There is a horizontal entrance about 200 feet
via easy passage from the pit entrance where the victim fell,
but no one involved was aware of this at the time. Stowe-
Rains stresses the need for cavers and cave rescue teams to
establish working relationships with fire departments and
teach them about cave rescue techniques and resources.


********** 3 August
McFails Cave, New York
flood entrapment
Bob Zimmerman led Richard Borowsky, Luis Esperanza,
and Mony Esperanza on what was intended to be "a short

---------- Page 22 ----------
1996 Accident and Incident Reports
pleasure trip" in McFails Cave. Zimmerman was very familiar
with the cave, having been in the cave more than two dozen
times while involved in surveying it over the years.
The cavers entered the cave without incident, locking the
gate behind them and placing the key on a ledge. They
reached the bottom of Coeymans Dome at about 11:30 a.m.
Leaving their vertical gear on a high ledge in the dome, they
started off down stream. The water level in the stream was
about three to four inches deep, which is typical for the cave.
After about five hours of caving, they started back towards
the entrance at about 4:30 p.m., expecting to be out of the
cave by 7:30. Zimmerman and Borowsky took a short break at
the First Breakdown Room, about 3,500 feet from the
entrance, while the two Esperanzas went ahead.
When they continued, Zimmerman and Borowsky were
startled to find the water level in the stream rising rapidly. It
became difficult to make progress against the flow, and they
soon had to climb up and chimney above the stream to move
forward. After about an hour, they caught up with the
Esperanzas at a formation known as The Brain. Borowsky was
unable to climb up out of the stream to the ledge above, and
was helped by the others. They were still over 2,000 feet from
the entrance. By this time the water level in the passage had
risen about six feet.
They decided that they would have to wait for the water
level to drop before continuing. At 7:30 p.m. they could see
that the flood was beginning to recede. By 11:00 p.m. the
level had dropped about two feet, and they were able to
chimney above the stream and move toward the entrance.
When they reached Coeymans Dome just before midnight, the
waterfall there was raging. They decided it was still too wet to
climb safely, and retreated to the Dreamland area where they
could climb up above the stream and wait another hour or two.
By 1:40 a.m. the water level had dropped another three
inches. All four cavers were cold and uncomfortable, and they
were running out of carbide. They decided that it was time to
go. The volume of the waterfall had decreased a bit, and they
were able to climb up without too much difficulty. They were
relieved to find that the flood had not washed away the key to
the gate, locking them inside. The reached the surface at about
5:00 a.m.

Caver, September 1996, p. 77.
2. Richard Borowsky, "It Never Floods in Summer, Met
Caver, September 1996, p. 48.
Comments: Zimmerman notes that he had never known the
cave to flood, except during spring rains. A severe storm cell
had passed over the cave at about 5:00 p.m., dumping several
inches of rain in a very short time. The soil may have been
saturated by heavier than normal rainfall in the preceding
weeks.
The cavers used plastic bags as hats and shirts to preserve
body heat and combat hypothermia. Their decision to wait out
the flood pulse was in part motivated by the fact that there
have been previous fatalities in the cave which involved
climbing in a waterfall.


********** 17 August
Hero Bucket Horror Hole, Tennessee
rockfall entrapment
Mike Rogers, Jack Thomison, Gerald Moni, Mike Ficco,
Dave Doolin, and Alan Cressler returned to Hero Bucket
Horror Hole to push a lead in the new cave that they had
opened by digging the previous day. Thomison and Rogers
started into the new passage after removing some more of the
debris. Thomison squeezed through a crawl to enter the new
section and was waiting for Rogers to follow.
Rogers started in with his feet first. When he was just
about through, the slab he was crawling under peeled off the
wall and crashed to the floor. Rogers' head and shoulders
were still in the crawl and the falling block squeezed him into
the floor and propelled him out. The block had knocked him
out of the way and just barely missed pinning him to the floor.
Everyone was stunned by the close call and the fact that
Rogers and Thomison were now trapped by the large block.
Moni left to get more tools and was able to borrow a large
sledgehammer from a friend who lived nearby. Meanwhile the
others were working with rock hammers both outside and
inside to break up the slab that was blocking the way. Finally,
after four hours of continuous work, Ficco was able to finish
breaking up the slab to allow Rogers and Thomison to escape.
Jack Thomison, Incident report, undated
Comments: Diggers must always be alert for signs of
instability. Collapse is an inherent risk in digging projects.
Use caution in virgin passage, and look for loose or suspect
rock.


********** 23 August
Moores Bridge Cave, Tennessee
caver fall
Two experienced vertical cavers were exiting Moores
Bridge Cave following a biological inventory trip. This
involved climbing a 20-foot rope pitch followed by 50 feet of
chimneying and climbing up a steep, narrow slot. While
getting off rope at the top of the 20-foot drop, the second
caver slipped and fell back down the pit. He suffered facial
and skull fractures and a broken wrist.
His partner heard the fall and heard him moaning.
Realizing what had happened, he quickly went outside to call
for help. Rescuers soon arrived, and the partner assisted
medical technicians in reaching the fallen caver. At first, the
caver was conscious and his condition seemed good, but it
declined as the rescue operation proceeded.
An additional cave rescue team was called in about two
hours after the accident, and the caver was eventually hauled
up the pit and out of the cave, exiting about five hours after
his fall. He was transported by helicopter to a nearby hospital,
where he was listed in critical condition. He later recovered.

August 1996.

---------- Page 23 ----------
1996 Accident and Incident Reports
Comments: Don't remove your safety ascender from the
rope until you are out of danger of falling. Perhaps the entire
slot should have been rigged SO that the cavers could have
remained on rope until completely out.
Britton notes that the cave is close to the road, close to
town, close to cave rescue resources, and not very difficult.
The victim was only 100 feet from the entrance. Still, the
rescue took five hours to accomplish and a caver nearly died.
As noted in other incidents described here, rescue call-outs
and operations are very time consuming, and even an
apparently simple rescue can take many hours. Britton also
suggests that it is foolish to take chances based on the belief
that rescue is nearby.
It was also reported that the initial response agencies were
not trained in cave rescue and were not fully aware of nearby
specialized cave rescue teams. It is the responsibility of such
teams to work with the local emergency response agencies,
establish good relationships, and make their capabilities
known. Legal responsibility and duty rests with these
authorities, and cavers have to communicate and work with
them regularly if they expect to be called.


********** 28 August
Wind-Ice Cave, Wyoming
stranded in pit, inadequate equipment
A group of three rock climbers attempted to make a pull-
down through-trip. They became stranded when they could
not find the way through after pulling down their rope. They
were reported overdue the next day. Rescuers quickly located
them and helped them exit the cave.
John Gookin, Incident report, 28 August 1996.
Comments: This was the second of two nearly identical
incidents at the cave in August. In the first incident, the cavers
were able to get out on their own by free-climbing all the
drops except the last one, which they ascended by climbing an
accessory cord they had left rigged. It's a good idea to be sure
someone knows the way through before committing to a pull-
down. At least someone knew where the cavers were.


********** 28 August
South Pittsburg Pit, Tennessee
caver fall, lost control on rappel
Karen Carr, Raleigh Marlin, Ray Nelson, and Dave
Keever (39) were visiting South Pittsburg Pit, a 160-foot
open-air shaft. Keever, who was the last to descend, rigged in
using only the top four bars of his six-bar rappel rack, and
attempted to do a "speed rappel." He intended to drop rapidly
into the pit and jam the bars together as he approached the
bottom, producing an effect similar to a bungee jump. He had
been practicing the maneuver for nearly a year, and intended
to impress the others.
Keever started his descent and quickly gained speed, but
when he attempted to slow himself by jamming the bars
together, he was unable to regain control. He crashed into the
floor of the pit two or three seconds later at a high rate of
speed, knocking the lights off of his helmet and scattering
batteries around the area. He was stunned by the impact, but
did not lose consciousness.
The others rushed to Keever's aid and checked him for
injuries. They helped him get off rope and collect his gear. He
found that he was able to stand and walk, but felt pain in his
lower back, and was unable to bend at the waist. After some
discussion, he decided that he would be able to climb out on
his own. He climbed slowly, with Marlin climbing alongside
on another rope. Keever was able to walk down to his truck,
and Carr drove him home. He put his gear away and cleaned
up, then went to the hospital. X-ray and CAT scans revealed a
compression fracture of the L1 vertebrae, with two separated
fragments and debris close to the spinal cord. He was fitted
with a full body brace and kept in the hospital for five days.
He wore the brace for four months.
David Keever, Incident report, 24 July 1998.
Comments: Keever gets right to the point in his own
analysis: "Stupid, stupid, stupid! That urge to 'showboat'
nearly killed me. I placed others at risk - inexcusable!
Reckless, irresponsible, I've got a long list of adjectives that
describe my actions that day, and none of 'em are favorable.
Why go any faster than needed for a smooth descent?"
At the risk of overstating the point, speed kills. Even if
you don't lose control and crash, fast rappels and sudden stops
are hard on the rope, the equipment, and the caver. All three
will eventually be damaged. It may look cool on TV, but it is
not the way to cave. Also, using only four bars on a six-bar
rack is a dangerous and unsafe practice. As Keever learned,
most cavers find that four bars do not provide enough control
for safe descent. If one bar gets knocked loose going over the
lip, as has been known to happen, the remaining three may not
be enough to stop a fall. Use five or six bars and spread them
as needed for a smooth descent.


********** 14 September
Reeves Cave, Indiana
lost, inadequate equipment
Michael Lorance and three other experienced cavers
arrived at Reeves Cave at about 8:00 a.m. on a Sunday
morning. They were surprised to see another vehicle already
at the parking area. The entered the four-mile long cave
system planning a fun day of exploration.
As they approached the Chandelier Room, they heard
voices calling for help. Arriving in the room, they found two
young men eagerly awaiting their arrival. They appeared to be
in good condition, though Lorance noticed that one was
barefoot. They had entered the cave on Saturday afternoon
and had subsequently become lost. When they were unable to
find the way out, they returned to the high room out of the
water and sat down to wait.
Lorance and companions provided the young men with
food, water, dry clothing, and heat pads. When they were
ready to go, they escorted the men out of the cave. Lorance
noticed that the two were looking pretty tired and frazzled
until they saw they entrance light, at which point "it was as if
they had been shot out of a cannon." They reached the surface
around 11:00 a.m. As the group enjoyed the warm sunshine,

********** 14 September
Trent Chasm, Alabama
equipment problem
Paul Deaver and three other cavers were preparing to
descend the 209-foot pit in Trent Chasm when Deaver
accidentally dropped his pack down the pit. His climbing gear
was in the pack, along with a camera, a can of Beanie-
weenies, a water bottle, a lighter, and two carbide lamp
bottoms. The impact made an impressive noise.
Deaver rappelled the pit and located the pack. The camera,
lighter, can of food, and two lamp bottoms were all crushed.
Nevertheless, he deemed the climbing gear safe to use. He
climbed out of the pit without further incident
Huntsville Grotto Newsletter, Oct./Nov. 1996, v38n10, p. 9.
Comments: How many cavers would be comfortable using
that climbing gear?


********** 19 October
Cave Mountain Cave, West Virginia
abrasion resulting in staph infection
Carl Moore was exploring Cave Mountain Cave with a
group from the Fall VAR convention. While squeezing
through a tight spot, he tore the right arm of his coveralls and
suffered a small scratch on his elbow. He had forgotten to
pack his elbow pads and his first aid kit. He continued the trip,
leaving the cave several hours later, and did nothing to clean
or dress the wound.
The abrasion to his elbow never healed, and in December
infection caused a 105-degree fever and severe swelling. He
sought treatment at a hospital, where the infection did not
respond to antibiotics. His condition worsened, and
osteomyelitis (infection of the membrane surrounding bone)
was suspected.
After a long series of treatments, tests, and bone scans, he
underwent surgery in March. A large abscess and surrounding
necrotic material was removed. The abscess was caused by a
staphylococcus infection. Following the surgery, Moore
recovered.
Carl Moore, Incident report, 10 April 1997.
Comments: Moore writes: "My arm recovered, but I lost
four months of caving, expended much of my sick leave, and
experienced four months of pain because I neglected one of
the most basic of caving safety precautions - bring a first aid
kit and use it when necessary."

Laurel Caverns, Pennsylvania
struck head, suspected neck injury
A group of about 70 middle school students from
Pittsburgh was on a guided trip through the undeveloped
section of the cave when a 13-year old girl struck her head
and was injured. She was wearing a helmet, but the force of
the blow was severe enough that the guide decided that
medical assistance was warranted.
Part of the group was sent out to summon help. Local
emergency services agencies were called, as well as cavers
from local grottos. Rescuers immobilized the girl's head and
spine and placed her in a litter. She was then carried out of the
cave and transported by ambulance to a local hospital.
Doug Moore, Incident report, NCRC Eastern Region web site,
29 October 1996.
Comments: Very similar to the July 4 incident. Moore
notes that this rescue took five hours to accomplish. It is
important to remember that even simple cave rescues often
take hours to mobilize and execute.

Saltpeter (Pendleton) Cave, West Virginia
rockfall entrapment
George Dasher and Ed Saugstad were surveying in a large
room accessed by a steep crawlway up through the floor. As
Dasher moved back to read the compass, the floor collapsed
into the crawl. A three-foot long by two-foot wide by 18-inch
thick block had fallen into the opening, preventing their exit.
The block was too big and too well seated to move. Their
companions were unable to help them from below. After some
maneuvering, the trapped cavers were able to move enough
rocks to create a new opening that bypassed the block. They
were only trapped for about 15 minutes.
George Dasher, "WVACS Activities, The West Virginia
Caver, December 1996, v14m6, p. 22.
Comments: Dasher notes that they failed to notice the
obvious unstable rock hanging over the crawlway. He was
tired and was concentrating on the survey. Fortunately, he and
Saugstad are both experienced diggers, and were able to open
up another exit.

********** 2 November
Pine Hill Cave, Kentucky
caver fall
Jean Trowbridge, her husband Lee, their daughter Kirsten,
and Tom Karaus were leading a caving trip for 12 college
students from Florida. Jean Trowbridge led the students in
through the horizontal entrance while Lee, Kirsten, and Tom
rigged and rappelled the Skylight Dome entrance.
The two groups met at a junction, where Kirsten
Trowbridge announced that she was not feeling well and
wanted to go out. Lee accompanied her out of the cave via the
horizontal entrance and drove her back to their camp.
The others continued their trip, having no difficulties until
they reached a deep pool. While traversing along the wall to
avoid the pool, Lisa Liebold (20) took a long step, missed the
foothold, and sprained her ankle. The group had a first aid kit,
and an ace bandage was applied to Liebold's ankle. She was
able to walk with some help. Jean Trowbridge and one of the
students started out of the cave with Liebold while Karaus
took over as leader and continued the trip with the other
students.
Lee Trowbridge returned to the cave and entered via the
Skylight Dome rappel, expecting to meet the others at the
bottom. After waiting several hours he decided to climb out.
As he reached the top, Karaus and the students arrived at the
bottom. Karaus was not able to communicate the details of the
accident to Trowbridge, but did establish that he would not be
climbing and that it was OK to de-rig the pit. Trowbridge
removed the rope and returned to the vehicles.
Liebold and her companions made slow progress through
the cave, taking frequent rest breaks. They exited and arrived
at the vehicles shortly after Lee Trowbridge and about 15
minutes before Karaus and the rest of the group. Liebold's
ankle recovered in about four weeks.
Jean Trowbridge, Incident report, 8 February 1997.
Comments: Trowbridge notes that she has been through
the cave many times and usually winds up swimming across
the pool. She notes that the cavers were already soaked from
climbing waterfalls, but that beginners often expend a lot of
effort trying to keep out of the water. This sometimes exposes
them to unnecessary dangers. Trowbridge also expressed
concern that Lee wound up doing the pit solo.

Rogers Discovery Cave, Kentucky
caver fall, climbing without belay
Shelly Wolf, Pat Marcee (19), Chris Gilbert, and three
other cavers entered the cave on Saturday morning,
descending a 30-foot handline slope at the entrance, a 15-foot
drop, a 20-foot climb, and a 75-foot pit. After exploring at the
bottom of the drop, the group started out.
While ascending the 75-foot pit, Wolf noticed a hole in the
wall about 30 feet off the floor. She pointed out the lead to
Marcee, who decided to climb up and check it out. Wolf also
tried to swing over to the lead.
About 17 feet off the floor, Marcee lost his grip and fell,
breaking his left leg below the knee. The other members of the
group were around a corner and did not see the accident. Wolf
called down to the others, who came to Marcee's aid.
Wolf climbed the pit and retrieved a sleeping bag, an
inflatable pad, water, an emergency blanket, and other
supplies to help keep the injured caver warm. The cavers
placed Marcee on the pad and wrapped him in the blanket and
sleeping bag. Gilbert left the cave to call for help.
Rescuers responded, and Marcee was carried out of the
cave and taken to a hospital after a 12-hour ordeal.
1. Shelly Wolf, Incident report, 28 December 1996.
2. Christopher Gilbert, Personal communication, 30 May

Comments: Gilbert notes that Marcee was an experienced
caver and climber who should have known better than to
attempt the climb without a belay. He had safety equipment
available, but chose not to use it.

Whitings Neck Cave, West Virginia
caver fall
A woman fell in a cave in the Whitings Neck area early on
Sunday morning. The woman was about 250 feet from the

difficulty on rope, equipment problem
John Chenger, Garret, and Tammy arrived at the parking

received permission from the owner. They were surprised to
see another vehicle present. When they arrived at the cave
entrance they encountered three men, Jim (the leader), Will,

men claimed to be NSS members from Maryland, and gave a
vague story about having received permission from a man
they ran into in the woods while visiting another nearby cave.
John and his companions gave them the benefit of the doubt
and accepted the story. Jim claimed to have been to the cave
several times before, which struck Chenger as odd because the
cave had been closed for several years.
The two groups rigged separate ropes, and Chenger did
not pay much attention to the Maryland group except to
observe that Jim was using a sewn harness made of cotton
webbing while his companions tied Swiss seats with webbing.
Chenger and companions then watched as the Maryland group
used a thin polypropylene line to lower several packs, propane
lanterns, and some kind of military surplus cylinder into the
pit before descending.
Once the first group was clear, Chenger rigged in to his
own 300-foot rope and descended. The pit is broken into three
parts, an initial 80-foot drop, a 15-foot waterfall drop, and a
final 50-foot drop to the bottom level and the main trunk
passage. Chenger found the Maryland group had gone down
the 15-foot drop, and could hear them discussing something
below. He called to Garrett and Tammy to come down, which
they did.
When Chenger attempted to descend the 15-foot drop, he
was surprised to find his rope loaded from below. The
Maryland group was apparently using it to descend the final
50-foot drop. It turned out that their 200-foot rope did not
reach, SO they helped themselves to Chenger's rope. When the
rope was clear, Chenger rappelled the 15-footer to find Sam
instructing Will in rappelling technique. Jim had already gone
down the last drop.
Tammy and Garret had seen enough by this time, and
elected to climb back to the surface to prepare for the likely
rescue. Chenger followed Sam and Will down the 50-foot
drop to talk to Jim. He too had seen enough, and wanted to
leave and take his 300-foot rope with him. He offered to re-rig
the Maryland group's unused 150-foot rope in the last drop,
SO that he would not have to wait while they climbed.
Sam and Will announced that if Chenger was leaving, they
wanted to leave too. Jim disagreed, and an argument ensued.
Chenger had had enough, and announced that he was going up
and would drop down another rope for the three. When he
reached the top of the 50-foot pit, however, it was clear that
the other Maryland rope would not reach. Before he could
retrieve the 150-foot rope to rig the drop, the others started
climbing out on Chenger's rope. He was forced to wait for
them.
Will and Sam both had trouble getting over the lip and
required help from Chenger. All three Maryland cavers were
using makeshift climbing systems, and were clearly
inexperienced in vertical caving technique. Sam climbed the
wet 15-foot drop with help from Chenger, who then followed.
While Will and Jim climbed the wet drop, Sam and Chenger
started up the final 80-foot climb on separate ropes. Part way
up, Chenger adjusted Sam's climbing rig, adding another foot
loop and making it much easier for Sam to climb. In the
process, he dropped a glove, and rappelled back down to
retrieve it while Sam continued his ascent.
As Sam neared the top, he discovered that his seat harness
was coming apart. He called up to Tammy and Garret, who
rigged a belay line and prepared to drop it down to Sam.
Unfortunately, Sam did not know how to tie any knots, SO
Garret quickly tied a figure-8 loop sized to fit over Sam's
shoulders and under his arms.
Chenger climbed up and checked the harness, finding that
the knot on the Swiss seat was OK, but that the harness was
very loosely tied and was sagging down around Sam's thighs
whenever he stood up. By this time, Will and Jim had arrived
at the bottom of the 80-foot drop and were attempting to get
on rope under two climbers. Chenger yelled at them to leave
the ropes alone and wait until they were clear.
Sam was hypothermic and beginning to panic, SO Chenger
called up and asked Tammy and Garret to get their cable
ladder and rig it into the pit. They did so, and Sam climbed the
ladder on belay and made it out of the pit. Chenger then
climbed out followed by Will and Jim.
Sam appeared to realize how close he had come to serious
injury. Will also listened carefully as Chenger and the others
explained proper safety procedures and made suggestions for
improvement. Jim, however, was unfazed, and commented
only that it was an easy drop and he didn't know what Sam's
problem was.
John Chenger, "Close Cave Catastrophe, West Virginia,
West Virginia Caver, April 1997, v15n2, p. 4.
Comments: The Maryland cavers did not have permission
and were trespassing. They were inadequately equipped and
unprepared for the cave. They were fortunate that Chenger
and his friends were there to help them. We have included this
lengthy account as an illustration of how inexperienced cavers
can get into serious trouble without realizing it or appreciating
the danger. There are no substitutes for good judgement,
proper training, and experience.


********** 30 November
Fisher Ridge Cave, Kentucky
flood entrapment
Brian Davis and five other cavers planned to spend the
Thanksgiving holiday weekend surveying from a base camp in
Fisher Ridge Cave. Three cavers entered at noon on Thursday.
Davis and two other cavers entered at noon on Friday. They
entered by the same entrance and route used nine months
earlier on the February 20 trip. They were not concerned

---------- Page 27 ----------
1996 Accident and Incident Reports
about flooding, because the low crawlway which had sumped
in February had since been enlarged and modified to make
flooding less likely.
Upon reaching the base camp site, Davis noticed that the
water level in the spring near the camp was high. By 3:00 a.m.
Saturday, its volume had increased dramatically. After some
sleep, both groups decided to abandon their survey plans and
leave the cave.
When they reached the low crawl, the cavers found that it
had once again flooded. They spent three hours digging a
trench to help drain the sump. After waiting another three
hours, they could not see any improvement. They spent three
more hours enlarging the trench to promote drainage, then
settled down to wait.
After a meal and some sleep, they returned to the crawl to
check the water. This time they found a six-inch airspace
above the water. Two cavers started through to see whether
the way was clear. They found that the entire crawl was
flooded for 400 to 500 feet, with air space ranging from six to
18 inches. The two cavers made it through, exiting at dawn on
Monday. The others waited for the water to drop further, then
followed. All the cavers were out by early afternoon.
Brian Davis, Incident report, 14 December 1996.
Comments: They were trapped for about 48 hours. This
was the second flood entrapment at this cave in 1996. The
local forecast before the trip was for scattered showers. Davis
notes that the cavers were confident that their modifications to
the crawlway would prevent a repeat of the February 20
entrapment. This confidence proved to be unfounded. At least
this time there was no callout and rescue response.


********** 14 December
Jewel Cave, South Dakota
illness, forced bivouac in cave
Keen Butterworth, Marc Ohms, Stan Allison, and Mike
Wiles were on a trip in Jewel Cave when Butterworth began
to feel ill. He felt he could continue, SO the group proceeded.
When they reached their destination, however, Butterworth
became very ill and began to suffer vomiting and diarrhea.
The group started out of the cave - a six-hour trip for a
healthy caver, involving five miles of passage. Butterworth
moved slowly, and became dehydrated when he was unable to
take water or food. About halfway out, the group reached
Cloud Nine - a room where rescue supplies were stored.
Butterworth rested while the others heated a package of soup.
He was able to keep the soup down, and began to feel better.
They continued for another hour until they reached the site
of another rescue cache. Butterworth was unable to travel, and
they decided to let him spend the night there to rest. Allison
stayed with Butterworth, while Ohms and Wiles headed out,
planning to return with help and supplies if the others did not
follow by 9:00 a.m.
Butterworth awoke the following morning feeling much
better, and was able to hold down some food and water. He
and Allison started out, and exited at 8:00 a.m.
Marc Ohms, Incident report, 30 January 1997.
Comments: Ohms observes that Butterworth should have
spoken up sooner when he realized he was becoming too ill to
continue. He admits, however, that this can be difficult to do,
especially when the potential for a big breakthrough is very
high, as it was on this trip. He also suggests that the others
might have paid more attention to Butterworth when he first
mentioned not feeling well, SO that they could have
encouraged him to start out sooner. Ohms also notes that the
pre-placed rescue packs helped prevent a more serious
situation.


********** 23 December
Blowing Springs Cave, North Carolina
caver fall, climbing ladder without belay
Gary Lynn Adams (35), Jason McElreath, Travis Dockins,
and Lee Kisselburg entered Blowing Springs Cave armed with
hammers, chisels, and a home-made rope ladder. McElreath
and Kisselburg had been to the cave before, and had been
stopped by a 48-foot pit about 700 feet into the cave. They
could hear the sound of water below, and wanted to reach the
waterfall and search for fossils.
They entered the cave at about noon on Monday, and
Adams soon discovered that the cave was a tight fit for his
five-foot nine-inch, 220-pound frame. By 12:30, he had
decided caving "wasn't my thing." He wanted to reach the
waterfall and collect fossils, however, SO he pushed and
squeezed and shoved himself through the tight passages. At
times, his companions pushed and pulled on his arms and legs
to get him through the tightest spots. Dockins soon decided
that he'd had enough, and left the cave. The others persevered,
and reached the top of the 48-foot pit around 2:30 p.m.
Kisselburg expressed concern, and suggested that they
should not descend. Adams was determined to see the
waterfall, and volunteered to go first. They rigged
McElreath's homemade rope ladder, and Adams climbed
down. They did not have a belay rope. Adams writes that the
descent "took every ounce of strength I had." On bottom, he
tried to squeeze into a six-foot wide, one-foot high crawl to
follow the sound of the water, but did not fit. He began
working with a hammer and chisel to enlarge the opening,
while McElreath descended. He was also unable to fit through
the opening. Kisselburg called down that he was getting cold,
and the two decided it was time to leave.
McElreath climbed first, and had some difficulty. About
ten feet below the top, he stopped climbing and announced
that he did not think he could make it. He rested against a
ledge for a few minutes, then made it to the top. Adams then
started up, "confident I could make it because I worked out
regularly." About six feet below the top, he ran out of strength
and could not pull himself up the remaining rungs. When he
could no longer hold on, he fell to the bottom, glancing off the
wall on the way down.
When he regained consciousness, he found himself lying
on the floor of the pit. He could move his arms and legs, but
felt pain in his back and legs. He was afraid to try to get up.
His companions heard him moaning, and called down that
they would go for help. Both men exited the cave, leaving
Adams alone.

---------- Page 28 ----------
1996 Accident and Incident Reports
Adams' companions went to the nearby Nantahala
Outdoor Center to call for help. John Neach, an experienced
caver, promptly went to the cave and was the first to reach
Adams. Neach also requested that the Chattanooga-Hamilton
County cave rescue team be called. Cave rescue teams from
Chattanooga, Tennessee, Walker County, Georgia, and
Knoxville, Tennessee, were called by the local authorities,
who also called in local cavers to assist. Neach and a
paramedic reached Adams several hours after the fall, and
stayed with him for nearly 15 hours during the rescue
operation.
Rescuers reached Adams about 2:30 a.m. on Tuesday
morning. He was placed in a Sked litter and hauled up the pit.
The combination of Adams' size and the tight passages made
it extremely difficult to move him through the cave. Rescuers
were forced to spend hours working to enlarge the passage
enough for him to fit through, moving thousands of pounds of
rock and making extensive modifications to the cave passage.
Adams was brought to the surface at about 5:00 p.m. on
Tuesday, and was transported to a hospital. He was found to
have only bruised ribs and abrasions, but was kept overnight
for observation.

Comments: Inadequate equipment, inexperience, poor
judgement, massive rescue, trashed cave. The men had no real
experience or training in safe caving, and did not know that
ladder climbs should always be belayed. Building your own
rope ladders for caving is also questionable. Experienced
cavers routinely use single rope technique for this pit. It is also
not a good idea to leave an injured person alone.
The rescue took 18 hours. Adams spent 26 hours in the
cave after his fall. Over 150 rescue workers were involved in
the operation. The Associated Press wire service report closed
with a quote from Adams: "Caves are for bats, and they
should be kept that way."

Cave Without A Name, Texas
caver fall, stranded, inadequate equipment
In his account of the incident, George Veni writes: "Cave
Without A Name is a fine, small show cave located about 40
kilometers northwest of San Antonio, Texas. It consists of a
large, well-decorated passage that extends about 200 meters to
a stream, where the tour trail ends.
"About 2:00 a.m. on 28 December 1996, five young men
from San Antonio broke through the gate and entered the
cave. They had been on a tour some time previously, and had
heard of a decorated upper-level passage located off-trail
down the stream. They used tour lights to light their way to
the water, then waded about 150 meters downstream. The
water reaches chest-depth, and airspace gets as low as 30
centimeters. Amazingly, they found the sometimes-hard-to-
find hand line that leads six meters up a slippery climb to the
upper passage, then began their ascent up a tricky and slippery
seven-meter free-climb into the decorated area.
"Somewhere near that point, their lights ran out of fuel,
and on trying to exit the passage, one of the team, Shane
Andrew Malone, fell and hurt his ankle. Reports conflict on
whether the ankle was broken or sprained. Two of his
companions, Joe Green and Brett Wilson, managed to get out
of the cave safely, while two others, John Edward Soto II and
Eric Virgil, stayed with him. The Kendall County Sheriff's
Department and Boerne Volunteer Fire Department
responded. During the past year, the BVFD was the site of a
National Cave Rescue Commission cave rescue training
course.
"Rescuers entered the cave at 8:40 a.m. and Malone, Soto,
and Virgil were out within about an hour. All three were
treated for hypothermia. No damage was done to the cave, and
the gate will be repaired courtesy of a metal working shop in
San Antonio. All five people were arrested and charged with
criminal trespass.
"The accident analysis was well-summarized by BVFD
Assistant Fire Chief Mike Fincke: 'They went down there
with just cigarette lighters and a whole load of stupidity.'
They were reduced to trying to find their way out of the cave
using the illuminated dial on Virgil's watch."

Susie Drop, Alabama
difficulty on rope
Carl Craig rigged in to descend Susie Drop, a 98-foot pit,
by first placing his quick-attach safety ascender on rope, then
rigging his rappel rack below it. He left the safety ascender on
the rope as he squeezed through the tight slot at the top of the
pit. As he lowered himself in, his rack caught on a projection
of rock, popping the fourth bar off rope and spreading the
remaining bars. He began to fall, but was saved by the
ascender attached to his harness.
Huntsville Grotto Newsletter, v38n10, p. 3.
Comments: A nice example of the importance of the
quick-attach safety ascender. Craig notes that he does not
remove it from the rope until he is hanging free and ready to
rappel. Many experienced vertical cavers recommend wearing
your full climbing system while rappelling, SO that the safety
ascender is readily available and you are ready to do a
changeover if any problem develops during descent.

caver fall, stranded in pit
Nathan Payne (16) and three teenaged companions were
exploring the cave when Payne slipped and fell about six feet
in a pit known as Hell Hole Number 2. He injured his wrist in
the fall, and was unable to climb back out of the hole. His
companions went for help, and local rescue squad members
were notified shortly before 3:00 p.m. It took about an hour
for rescuers to reach Payne. Once they hauled him out of the
pit, he was able to walk out with some assistance.

Comments: The newspaper article noted that this was the
second rescue at the cave in two months. No information was
available on the other incident.


********** 18 January
Ogle Cave, New Mexico
difficulty on rope, stranded
Melynne Conway, Gary Mahan, Meliene Davis, and Bill
Sawyer visited Ogle Cave accompanied by park employees
Jason Richards and Paul Mauermann. Richards was first to
make the 180-foot descent of the entrance pit, followed by
Mahan. Conway was the third person down, and took about
30 minutes on the rappel. The typical time for this descent is
about five minutes, and Richards became concerned. He also
heard Conway comment that she hoped she would be able to
climb out. As a result, he decided to shorten the tour to allow
more time to exit.
When the group was ready to climb the pit, Richards sent
Mauermann up first, followed by Mahan. Conway climbed
about 80 feet in 30 minutes. She then climbed another 20 feet
before becoming exhausted. After a 15-minute break, she still
felt unable to continue. Richards called up to the top and
instructed Mauermann to radio for help. Richards was
concerned about harness compression, and urged Conway to
move around and try to keep climbing. She managed to
ascend another 16 feet before help arrived.
Park personnel Lance Mattson, Harry Burgess, Dale Pate,
and David Hall arrived at the top, along with caver Joel
Williams. They rigged a second rope, and Mattson rappelled
down to Conway and changed her over from ascent to rappel.
Richards belayed Conway as she rappelled back down to a
ledge. Richards secured Conway to the ledge and climbed out
to help with the hauling. Conway was then hauled up the pit,
reaching the surface at about 9:30 p.m.
Incident report, Carlsbad Caverns National Park, 18 January
1997.
Comments: It's always helpful to have a second rope
available, but it is better not to need one. Cavers should know
how to change over and descend, and should use that option
before becoming totally exhausted. Cavers waiting at the
bottom should know how to climb up and help a stranded
caver get back down. The maneuver is called a pick-off, and
requires practice, but it can save lives. Exhausted cavers
hanging on rope are at serious risk.
Every vertical caver should know how to do these things.
You don't always have time to send out for or rig another
rope. The NCRC training courses provide a good place to
learn. The cavers had assured the park personnel that they
were prepared for the 180-foot pit. Where cavers are
unknown, asking for evidence (such as past experience) of
such assertions may be worthwhile.


********** 13 February
Sunny Jims Cave, California
stranded, washed into sea cave
Matt Tickner (25) was rescued by a lifeguard after being
trapped in Sunny Jims Cave. He had apparently been washed
into the cave after jumping from a 90-foot promontory known
as Deadmans. Authorities began searching the area after
receiving a 911 call at 11:30 p.m. from a man claiming that
his brother had jumped from the cliff.
Lifeguards searching the area below the cliff heard
Tickner's yells from inside the cave. Lifeguard Wayne Auer
was able to swim into the cave and help Tickner up to a
landing at the base of a stairway leading to a shell shop on the
road above. Auer later reported that it appeared that Tickner
had been drinking, and did not want to risk swimming back
out. Tickner then waited there while Auer swam back out to
contact the shop owner about opening the stairway door.
When Auer returned to the cave equipped with a rope and
rescue buoy, Ticker agreed to swim out under tow. Auer
towed him out of the cave and helped him up the trail to the
road. Tickner was fully clothed, and denied jumping from the
cliff. He refused medical treatment.

Cueva Cheve, Oaxaca, Mexico
rockfall entrapment, caver fall
Carl Bern (23) and Steve Wells (24) were making their
way back to the entrance following a trip in the upper portion
of Cueva Cheve. They were about 20 minutes from the
entrance, moving through large passage with some breakdown
when they came to a ledge along one wall. Bern walked across
and climbed down from the far end. When Wells followed,
part of the ledge broke loose from the wall, sending both
Wells and a four-foot diameter by two-foot thick slab down

---------- Page 30 ----------
1997 Accident and Incident Reports
on top of Bern. The slab landed on Bern's left leg, pinning
him to the floor. Wells landed nearby and injured his ankle.
Fortunately, Bern's leg was sheltered by a crack in the
floor and was not crushed by the slab, which was estimated to
weigh about 700 pounds. Some of the weight of the slab was
on Bern's leg and foot, restricting his circulation below the
knee. Though injured himself, Wells came to Bern's aid and
the two used some webbing and carabiners to rig a 2:1 haul in
an attempt to move the slab. When this failed, Wells left to get
help.
Wells hobbled and crawled out of the cave, taking about
30 to 40 minutes to reach the entrance. Other members of the
expedition were in camp just outside, and responded
immediately, taking vehicle jacks, hammers, and other
equipment. Matt Oliphant and Page Ashwell were the first to
reach Bern, about an hour after the accident. They were able
to use the 2:1 haul to shift the rock and stabilize it, which also
restored Bern's circulation below the knee.
When the others arrived with additional equipment, they
rigged another haul system to further stabilize the slab. The
decided not to try to lift or pull if off for fear of crushing
Bern's leg. Instead, the used hammers to break off the part of
the slab that was still pinning Bern's foot. Once that
projection was removed, Bern was able to slide his leg out
from under the rock. Bern had no broken bones and was able
to leave the cave under his own power.
Several days later, Wells and Bern made a two-hour drive
to the nearest doctor. There was no X-ray machine available,
and Wells was diagnosed with a sprained ankle. Bern had two
half-dollar sized patches of necrotic tissue on his calf from
compression by the rock. Both men rejoined the expedition
and continued caving. When Wells returned home several
weeks later, he was still experiencing pain in his ankle. He
had it examined, and the X-ray showed that he had fractured
one of the bones in his ankle. He later had surgery to pin and
repair the ankle.

2. Carl Bern, Personal communication, 16 March 2000.
Comments: Sometimes there is just no way to spot loose
rock or other dangers in the cave. It is one of the inherent risks
of caving. The men had been dealing with loose rock
throughout the trip, and were alert to the danger. Bern was
lucky that his leg was not crushed. He noted that he was also
fortunate to have a group of experienced cavers camped right
at the entrance. He wrote: "If the response time had been any
longer the stone tourniquet might have claimed my leg." Note
the use of vehicle jacks as improvised rescue tools.

Pettijohns Cave, Georgia
caver fall, descending hand-over-hand
At about 6:30 p.m. Bradley Hood (20) was using a knotted
rope to descend a 20-foot drop into the Volcano Room. He
lost his grip on the muddy rope and fell about 15 feet, landing
on a rock and injuring his lower back. He was in a lot of pain
and felt that he could not get out on his own, SO his
companions left the cave and called 911 for help.
Cave rescue teams responded, and a 70-person rescue
operation ensued. Hood was packaged in a litter and carried
out of the cave, reaching the surface at 7:26 a.m. He was
transported to a nearby hospital where he was found to have
cracked several vertebrae. He was placed in a back brace and
released the next day.
Allen Padgett, Incident report, 17 February 1997.
Comments: This is yet another hand-over-hand casualty.
Hood was carrying a flashlight and was not wearing a helmet.
Pettijohns Cave is located in a state wildlife management area
and is visited by more than 10,000 people each year. Most of
its visitors are as poorly equipped and prepared as this young
man. Surprisingly, this was the first major rescue in the cave
in almost eight years.

Secret Pit, Alabama
rockfall
Victor Bradford and David Drake were spending the day
bouncing pits in the Paint Rock Valley and decided to do
Secret Pit, a 144-foot open-air drop. They rigged to some
nearby trees and Drake descended. While he was waiting for
Bradford to rappel, a small rock fell and hit the floor near the
rope. Bradford reached the bottom and Drake prepared to
climb out. When Bradford spotted a register, he insisted they
both sign it. Drake walked over to do SO. Suddenly, a
"volleyball-sized" rock fell from above, landing near the rope
with a loud impact. The men were startled but not injured, and
both climbed out without further incident.
David Drake, "Secret Pit, Cullman Grotto Flowstone, March
1997, v4n3, p. 3.
Comments: Drake notes: "Had Vic not seen the register
and insisted we sign it, one of us, probably me, would have
been on rope at the time of the rockfall. Apparently we had
disturbed its resting place near the top of the pit on our rappel,
and it took a few minutes for it to release from the viscous
grip of its muddy bed." It's always good practice to check the
lip and clear loose or suspicious rocks, and to avoid standing
in the rockfall zone at the bottom of pits. A rock that size
falling that distance could kill even a helmeted caver.

scalp injuries as well as other abrasions during the fall. He
tried to climb out, but became stranded in a crack partway up.
His companion gathered some vines and attempted to
lower them to the man, hoping he could use them to climb out.
Eventually, the second man decided to call for help. Park
rangers responded and called in the cave rescue team. The

suspected that they were engaged in the illegal collection of
artifacts. Digging tools, a metal detector, and other items of
evidence were found hidden nearby.

several hours touring the cave. About halfway back to the
campsite, Dale lost his footing, stumbled, and fell off a ledge,
injuring his left foot.
After a brief discussion, Dale and his companions decided
that he could make it out with some assistance. It took about
three hours for him to reach the entrance. He was driven to a
hospital, where X-rays determined that he had not broken any
bones but had damaged the ligaments in his foot. He was
fitted with a cast, which he was to wear for six weeks.

smell. The found chemicals and other paraphernalia
apparently stored in a high passage. They reported the
situation to the county sheriff's office, which dispatched
investigators from the Narcotics Division. Investigators
summoned the cave rescue team to assist.
The investigators determined that the equipment was an
illegal drug lab, which had been broken down for storage. The

and local cavers were warned of the presence of potentially
hazardous materials.

A group of five individuals arrived at the cave late in the
afternoon, equipped only with a few hand-held flashlights.
Several in the group began exploring rooms just inside the
entrance. While climbing on rocks outside the cave entrance, a
30-year-old man slipped and fell. He suffered severe injuries,
and died within minutes. Some of the group left to summon
help. His companions carried the body down to the road
where they met area rescue squad personnel. Investigators
reported alcohol use by the victim and companions. They did
not have permission to be on the property, which was posted.
Tim Kilby, "Caving fatality," Cavers Digest #5433, 1 April
1997.
Comments: The group did not have helmets or other safety
equipment. They had no knowledge of safe caving practices.

Ellisons Cave, Georgia
caver fall, rope failure
Paul Bowen and several cavers from a local grotto visited
Ellisons cave and descended the 125-foot Warm Up Pit.
While his companions were climbing back up, Bowen
explored the area at the bottom and found a rope hanging
down in an alcove. He decided to climb up and see where it
went. He rigged on with his climbing gear and began the
ascent. When he was about 25 feet up, the rope broke and he
fell to the floor. He received cuts and bruises, but no serious
injuries. He was able to exit the cave under his own power.

#1032, 20 March 1997.
2. Allen Padgett, "Ellisons Rope Incident, TAG-Net #1039,
27 March 1997.
Comments: The rope was rigged from an 80-foot drop into
the Warm Up Pit from a passage leading to a seldom-used
entrance. It had been abandoned nine years earlier, and had
been hanging in a waterfall ever since. Bowen knew nothing
about the rope or its history.
Padgett observes: "The first lesson learned here is do not
assume any fixed line you find in a cave is in any way safe.
Research before you climb. The second lesson is do not

---------- Page 32 ----------
1997 Accident and Incident Reports
assume that it is obvious that no one would climb a line
abandoned such as this. If you place a rope it becomes your
duty to remove it."
If you have to ascend a doubtful rope, you should consider
testing it by having two or three cavers hang on the bottom. If
the rope or anchor falls, falling debris could be hazardous but
it is probably less SO than a falling caver. Bowen was lucky
not to be seriously injured or killed.


********** 25 April
Pinnacles Cave, Nevada
difficulty on rope, inexperience
Doug Billings and three other experienced cavers led
novice cavers Jim Crouch and Rick Temple on a grotto trip to
Pinnacles cave. The trip was to provide an introduction to
vertical caving for Crouch and Temple. They rigged two ropes
in the entrance pit and descended without incident.
The group set off to explore the cave, rigging an etrier at a
short climbdown and two more etriers at a second 15-foot
climbdown. This second drop was tight, and Crouch, who was
rather large, had some trouble. They rigged a short rope SO he
could rappel. Halfway down, he became wedged in a squeeze
while on rappel. He was stuck for about 20 minutes while the
others worked to free him. Crouch decided to wait at the top.
The others continued their exploration until they ran out of
time and had to start out. There was a brief problem when the
two ropes in the entrance pit became tangled while Malini
Killian was climbing. She was able to pass the tangle without
too much trouble. Crouch started his climb while Billings and
Temple waited at the bottom. He had trouble with the ascent
from the very start. He could not get his system to operate
correctly, and soon became exhausted. He was already tired
from his earlier experience in the slot. When the second rope
was free, Temple rigged on and began climbing. He soon
passed Crouch and exited the pit.
Billings then got on the second rope and climbed up beside
Crouch to help. He tried unsuccessfully to pull Crouch over
onto a nearby ledge. Finally, he decided they were going to
have to haul Crouch up. Billings got off rope on the ledge and
the cavers above pulled up his rope. They used pulleys to rig a
haul system and dropped the rope back down to Crouch, who
attached it to his harness. With assistance from the cavers
above, Crouch was able to continue climbing and exit the pit.
The rope was then dropped back down to Billings, who
climbed out.
Doug Billings, "Pinnacles Trip," 'The Troglodytes Tribune,
Quarter Four 1997, v2n3, p. 6.
Comments: Crouch had practiced with his system, a
modified Frog rig, at Billings' house before the trip but was
not yet skilled in its use. He was also a large person, and had
difficulty staying upright while on rope. Billings notes that the
system was not very efficient, and that Crouch was already
tired from the earlier difficulty in the slot. The cavers showed
good initiative and rescued their friend from a difficult
situation. Still, it is wise to be certain that you are capable
with your chosen system before venturing into a pit.


********** 2 May
Glow Worm Cave, Tennessee
flood entrapment
Don Hunter, Seamus Decker, Kim Grossman, Micah
Callough, and Suzanne Debois arrived at Glow Worm Cave
on a Friday afternoon, planning a short survey trip for the
evening. Bill Walter, the owner of the cave and an
experienced caver himself, expressed concern about the
crawlway given the forecast for evening thunderstorms.
Hunter did not think that a short duration rainfall - even from
a thunderstorm - would be a problem. They entered at about
5:30 p.m. through a low crawlway which had been known to
sump on occasion.
After traversing about 150 feet of low, downward sloping
belly-crawl, the group emerged into larger passage and began
surveying. About 30 minutes into the survey, they noticed that
the water flow was increasing. They dropped everything and
ran to the entrance crawl, where they found the passage
already sumped. Outside, it had begun to rain heavily. The
rain continued for several hours. The trapped cavers retreated
to a dry room and prepared to wait out the flood. They spent
the night huddled together for warmth.
Walter was concerned about the rain, but had confidence
in the cavers and their judgement, and did not check on them
that evening. At 6:00 a.m. the next morning, he received a call
from Jeff Dilcher, who had arrived too late on Friday for the
trip and was planning to survey with the group on Saturday.
Dilcher was concerned, and reported that the group had not
come out during the night.
Walter met Dilcher at the cave, where they found the
entrance to the 150-foot crawl sumped. They noticed a high
water mark about one foot above the current level, and
decided to monitor the rate of drop at hourly intervals. They
considered alerting cave rescue units, but decided that there
was nothing to be gained at that point, since they could only
wait for the water to recede. Walter felt that there had not
been enough rainfall to cause major flooding in the cave, and
that only the entrance crawl was flooded. They decided to see
about getting a pump to drain the crawl, and to keep checking
the water level.
Walter and Dilcher spent the next few hours trying to find
a way to pump out the crawl, but had no luck. The water was
too far into the cave to place a pump without creating
problems from the engine exhaust. At 12:30 p.m. they
returned to the cave to check the water and found about eight
inches of air space above the pool. Walter noticed air flowing
into the cave, and felt that the crawl must be open. He and
Dilcher went back to their vehicle to get wetsuits, planning to
enter and search for the missing cavers. When they returned to
the entrance, they found the others emerging unharmed. They
were all out by 1:00 p.m. The cavers were trapped for 19
hours.

********** 5 May
Arnold Hollow Cave, Arkansas
rockfall entrapment
At about 9:00 a.m., four people entered Arnold Hollow
Cave to push a small lead about 400 yards back in the cave,
hoping to gain entrance to a formation room believed to exist
beyond. Three women, Dell Lancaster (36), Diane Lancaster
(40), and Phyllis Nelson (64) accompanied the cave's owner,
John Nelson (40) on the trip.
When they arrived at the tight spot the three women went
through. John Nelson, described as a "rather robust fellow,"
decided to enlarge the crawl to allow himself easier access and
to make it easier for everyone on the way out. While digging
chert and hammering on some loose slabs of breakdown, he
caused a collapse that blocked the passage and left the three
women trapped inside. Nelson tried for about an hour to
remove the blockage, then left the cave to get help.
Local rescue and emergency services units responded, and
cavers were called in to assist. Rescuers examined the passage
and the collapse area, and decided that it would be too
dangerous to dig or move anything without shoring and
cribbing. They were able to pass food, clothing, and a small
stove to the women, who were calmly waiting in the larger
room beyond the collapse.
Personnel from a nearby silica mine offered to help, and
assisted cavers in cutting timbers and shoring up the passage.
Once that was complete, rocks were moved and chiseled to re-
open the passage. By 8:30 p.m. the entrance to the room was
open and the women exited the cave in good spirits.
Ed Corfey, Incident report, 17 May 1997.
Comments: Corfey writes, "The best lesson that can be
learned from this is that passage alteration should never be
done with people deeper in the cave. Entrapment is not to be
taken lightly. Rescue can be delayed and/or take hours or even
days. In this instance the collapse could have fallen on the
women causing serious injury. Being able to dig out a small
hole to pass blankets, food, water, and a heater helped prevent
hypothermia."


********** 14 May
Bull Cave, Tennessee
stranded, inadequate equipment
Four college students in their twenties entered the cave at
about 2:30 p.m. intending to descend the first two drops of 40
feet and 169 feet. They were not experienced cavers, and did
not have proper climbing systems and safety equipment.
All four descended the first pit, and two of the students
rappelled halfway down the 169-foot pit, stopping at a ledge
when they ran out of rope. They became stranded on the ledge
when they were unable to figure out how to use the Jumars
and other equipment they had available. It had been raining
earlier in the week, and the cave was very wet, with quite a bit
of spray on the ledge.
The two unfortunates yelled up to their companions above
and told them to go for help. One of them was able to climb
hand-over-hand up the 40-foot pit and exit the cave. He went
to the nearest house and called for help. Park rangers
responded, and called in a cave rescue team from Knoxville to
assist.
Rescuers entered the cave shortly after 7:00 p.m. and
rigged both drops with haul systems. Two of the students were
in fair condition and were assisted from the cave and treated
for hypothermia. The third had become severely hypothermic
while stranded on the ledge, and had to be placed in a litter
and carried out. He was transported to a hospital and treated
for hypothermia. The students were out of the cave by 9:45
p.m.
David Brace, "Bull Cave Rescue," TAG-Net #1089, 17 May

Comments: Brace reports that the men were fined the
maximum amount of $50 each for entering the cave without a
permit. Bull Cave is located in a national park, and is the
deepest cave in Tennessee at 741 feet.


********** 31 May
McBrides Cave, Alabama
caver fall, flood entrapment
Gerald Moni (52), Nancy Aulenbach (25), Forrest Platt
(22), Andy Zellner, Alan Cressler, Andy Porter, Steve Collins,
Gary Chambers, Brent Aulenbach, Shane Snyder, and Doug
Strait left the SERA Cave Carnival planning a "short but
sporting" pull-down trip in McBrides Cave. The cave has an
upper entrance and a lower spring entrance, connected by
6,000 feet of stream passage broken up by eight wet pits
ranging from 20 to 90 feet deep. It is a popular wetsuit vertical
cave, and is sometimes done in high water conditions to make
it easier to travel through some of the crawling sections.
It was raining as they left the campground, and had been
raining steadily for several days. The area forecast was for
continued rain and thunderstorms through the weekend. They
were confident that the cave would be passable, however, and
were encouraged when the rain abated somewhat as they
arrived at the cave.
They parked near the spring entrance, obtained permission
from the landowner, and hiked to the upper entrance, 450 feet
above the valley floor. The cave was taking a sizeable stream,
which disappeared into the boulders near the entrance. The
group entered the cave at about noon, climbing down a
chimney and then making two dry rappels of 23 and 34 feet
before encountering high water at the bottom of the second
drop. The water complicated the descent of the next pit, a 25-
foot drop. Several in the group remarked on the high water
level, noting that the third pit was normally dry. The cavers
pulled down the ropes and continued into the cave.
The water was higher than anyone remembered from
previous trips. Nevertheless, they moved through the cave
without incident until they reached a climbdown near the top
of the 90-foot pit. The climbdown is about eight feet, with a

---------- Page 34 ----------
1997 Accident and Incident Reports
plunge pool at the bottom. In 1992 a caver fell off this climb
and struck a hidden ledge in the pool, breaking her foot and
requiring rescue. Despite this, Cressler jumped down the
climb and into the pool, and encouraged Platt to do the same,
telling her where to jump to avoid hitting the submerged ledge
that had resulted in the earlier incident. Platt jumped and hit
the ledge, breaking her tibia just above the ankle.
They discussed retreating to a dry area and waiting while
some of the party could exit the cave and re-rig the upper pits
for her to climb out, but Platt decided that she would rather
keep moving and go out the lower entrance, which would
probably get her out sooner.
The group rigged the nearby 90-foot pit, and everyone
descended. The water was very strong, pounding the cavers as
they rappelled. Platt had some trouble on the descent, but
Chambers was able to belay from below and pull her to one
side of the waterfall. Brent Aulenbach's headlamp was
knocked down into his face, resulting in a cut on his nose.
Strait went last, after rigging the rope for pulldown. He
received a minor injury to his ankle during the descent.
Alternately carrying and assisting Platt, the group
continued down the next two pits. They came to a belly crawl
leading to the seventh drop - a 25-foot pit broken by a large
ledge nine feet down. The crawl is about 50 feet long, and in
the cave's flooded state had only a few inches of airspace
above the strong current. The rig point is in the stream crawl
right at the lip, and it can be difficult to descend even in low
water.
Porter scouted the passage, and reported that the rig point
was under water and that there were about two inches of
airspace in the one-foot high, eight-foot wide passage at the
edge of the pit. The cavers decided that they would have to
descend by gripping the rope with their hands and sliding
down to the ledge, where they would then be out of the water
and able to rig in and rappel the remaining 16 feet to the
bottom.
Several of the cavers made it through the crawl and down
the pit, including Platt. All had difficulty avoiding being
washed over the drop. Gerald Moni attempted to descend as
the others had. As he slid over the lip, however, he lost his
grip on the rope and fell to the ledge, nine feet below,
breaking his left femur. He cried out for help, and was heard
by the cavers waiting below. The time was 3:20 p.m.
Chambers climbed back up the 16-foot drop and found
Moni lying on the ledge. He called down to the others, told
them what had happened, and told them to go for help. Their
second rope was still somewhere above, SO Cressler cut a
section off of the excess rope hanging down. Accompanied by
Porter and Platt, he started for the next pit.
At that point, Steve Collins started down the nine-foot
drop. Chambers guided him down, and helped Collins avoid
landing on Moni. Several more cavers descended the nine-foot
drop, guided by Collins and Chambers. Nancy Aulenbach
broke a finger when her hand became pinched between the
rope and the rock as she went over the lip. The last two
cavers, Snyder and Zellner, did not come through.
The waterfall was arching out into the pit, leaving Moni
out of the flow. He did not want to be moved, and felt he
could wait where he was until help could be brought in.
Collins and Chambers stayed on the ledge with Moni, while
the others descended the remaining 16 feet to the floor and
started out.
By this time, Nancy Aulenbach was hypothermic and
could not stop shivering. She was wearing polypro and a cave
suit rather than a full wetsuit. The water appeared to be rising,
and they could not afford to be trapped in the cave. Strait led
the cavers toward the lower entrance.
They went through about 200 feet of low passage with
about five inches of airspace and arrived at the last pit. All of
the water funneled down a three-foot diameter hole and fell 25
feet to a deep pool. They descended the pit and made their
way through 2,500 feet of stream passage, including several
sections of low-airspace, to arrive at the spring entrance.
About one and a half hours passed after Moni's fall before
Zellner and Snyder were able to descend the nine-foot drop
and rejoin their companions. By this time, the low-airspace
passage leading from the bottom of the pit had sumped. Moni,
Chambers, Collins, Zellner, and Snyder were flooded in, and
spent the next 12 hours waiting and trying to keep warm.
Moni remained on the ledge, while the others waited in a
sandy room at the bottom of the 16-foot drop. Collins spent
much of the time with Moni, travelling up and down the 16-
foot drop to keep warm and check on the water.
Cressler, Porter, and Platt had exited the cave at about 4:30
p.m. and had gone to the cave owner's house to call for
rescue. Cressler and Porter then set up a stream gauge to
monitor the water level at the lower entrance. The water
continued to rise. Strait and the Aulenbachs made it out of the
cave at about 5:45 p.m. Platt and Nancy Aulenbach later went
to an emergency room for treatment, then returned to wait for
the others to come out.
Rescuers began to arrive at about 6:30 p.m. The water
level reached a peak at about 7:00 p.m., and then slowly began
to recede. Rescuers attempted to enter both entrances. At the
upper entrance, they were stopped by a siphon at the third
drop. A team entered the lower entrance and was able to make
its way to the bottom of the last pit, bypassing two sumps and
navigating several very-low-airspace sections while working
against the strong current.
The waterfall at the last pit presented a problem, which
was solved by pulling the rope to one side. Two cavers were
then able to climb up into the dry room at the top of the pit.
Pushing upstream, they were stopped by the siphon just below
the room where the trapped party was waiting. They retreated
to the dry room at the top of the last pit, notified the rescuers
outside, and waited for the water level to drop. They used a
small stove to heat tea and soup as they waited and watched
their stream gauge.
Over the next four hours, during which time the stream
level and weather conditions were closely monitored, the
water level slowly dropped. By 5:30 a.m. the water level had
dropped several inches - enough that rescuers were finally
able to get through to the trapped cavers.
Snyder, Zellner, Collins, and Chambers were cold but
unharmed. All were suffering from hypothermia, with Zellner
in the worst condition. He and Snyder were also wearing cave
suits and polypro rather than wetsuits. They were given food
and hot drinks, and were able to make their way out of the
cave without further assistance.

1997 Accident and Incident Reports
Moni was lowered from the ledge to the room below, then
placed in a Sked litter. He was in pain, but was reasonably
warm in his full wetsuit and nylon coveralls. Rescuers floated
him through the 200-foot long low-airspace passage to the
room at the top of the last pit. He was lowered down the drop
into the waiting hands of rescuers below.
A makeshift warming tent had been set up below, and
Moni rested there and was examined by medical personnel.
He was in very good shape considering his injury and the long
stay in cold wet conditions, and was ready to get out of the
cave. Teams of cavers moved him quickly through the
passage, and he was out of the cave by 1:45 p.m. He was
taken by helicopter to a hospital for treatment. He made a full
recovery.

Comments: The ground was saturated from the earlier
rains before the cavers arrived. Light rain continued after their
entry, and heavy rain fell in the late afternoon. The area
forecast indicated one to two inches of rain that afternoon. On
saturated ground, that was enough to cause a serious flood in
the cave. The evening forecast predicted heavy rain through
the night.
Fortunately, the predicted evening thunderstorms moved
by to the north, and the rain abated during the rescue. There
was serious concern that rescuers might become flooded in
along with the trapped cavers. Had the rain fallen as predicted,
the cave would likely have remained flooded through the next
day, and the outcome might have been very different. Several
of the trapped cavers were severely hypothermic by the time
rescuers reached them.
Members of the party later stated that they had not given
enough consideration to the weather conditions, and that they
should not have entered the cave that day. They were
expecting a fast trip in "sporting" conditions, and were not
prepared for a long stay underground. Some were
inadequately clothed for the conditions, wearing only polypro
and nylon cave suits. Those who had on full wetsuits fared
much better. Jumping into the pool was unwise, given its
history.
Cave trips can take on a momentum of their own. "Pull-
down" trips are especially committing. Cavers sometimes
need to stop, think, and discuss hazards and options before
making irrevocable decisions.


********** 31 May
McClungs Cave, West Virginia
caver fall
Eric Hadden (11) and 25 other boy scouts entered
McClungs Cave with four adult scout leaders. Some of the
scouts had been caving before, but others were on their first
caving trip. The leaders did not have much caving experience.
The scouts had helmets, but were carrying hand-held
flashlights. After about five hours of caving, the group was
headed out and moving through the Entrance Canyon. They
were about 25 or 30 minutes from the entrance when Hadden
lost his footing and fell about 15 feet down the canyon.
The group leaders notified authorities, and a rescue effort
including many local cavers was mobilized. Hadden was
placed in a litter and carried through the canyon and out of the
cave, exiting just after midnight. An ambulance was waiting to
take him to a hospital for treatment. Hadden spent the night in
the hospital and was released the next morning. He had no
broken bones, but was heavily bruised on one side from waist
to ankle.

2. Al Stubbe and Dave Socky, "McClungs Cave Rescue, The
Carbide Dump, June 1997, v32n6, p. 28.
Comments: The various reports point out several issues. In
the opinion of the cavers who know the cave, it is not suitable
for first-time cavers. There were too many scouts and not
enough adults. There were no experienced cavers with the
group. They were not properly equipped for the cave.
Traversing a cave often requires both hands, and this
canyon is reported to be slippery and exposed. Hand-held
flashlights are not suitable for primary caving lights - helmet-
mounted lights leave the hands free for caving. Finally, the
five-hour trip was probably too long and strenuous for the
group. Hadden was reportedly having difficulty before the
fall, and may have been exhausted.


********** 31 May
Spring Valley Cave, Minnesota
caver fall
Jay Kennedy was working on a solo aid climb on a wall in
the Colossal Room while three companions worked on a dig
downstream. He was about ten feet above his last anchor
when one of his aid pitons pulled out of its crack. Kennedy
fell about 20 feet, and his self-belay, a three-wrap prusik, slid
about 12 inches before catching the fall. Kennedy sustained
bruises and abrasions on his arms and right leg, but no serious
injury. His wetsuit provided some padding and protection,
softening the blow to his right tibia and possibly preventing a
fracture.
Kennedy checked himself for injury, and finding none,
climbed back up to his anchor and retrieved his slings. He
then descended from the wall, packed his gear, and left the
cave without further incident.
Jay Kennedy, Incident report, 4 June 1997.
Comments: Kennedy notes that he is a caver of 20 years
experience, and sometimes caves solo under controlled
circumstances. In this case, the other cavers were not far away
if assistance was needed, and he felt comfortable climbing
alone with a self-belay. After the fall, he decided to return to
the cave at a later date with a belayer and a drill to climb using
traditional bolting technique.

Schmitt Farm Cave, Iowa
caver fall, inadequate equipment
Three youths decided to descend the 60-foot entrance pit
and explore the cave at the bottom. Two of the youths lowered
the third down on a rope. When they attempted to pull him
back up, the rope broke. The young man fell about 15 feet to
the ground and broke both his wrists. The county search and
rescue team was called to rescue the stranded youth.
Marc Ohms, Incident report, 29 May 1997.
Comments: The youths were not using proper caving
equipment and techniques. It was reported that the Iowa
Grotto had done several mock rescue exercises with the
county search and rescue team. The time and training paid off.

unspecified cave, Kentucky
difficulty on rope, equipment problem
James Johnson was on rope climbing a pit in a multi-drop
cave in Kentucky when one of the foot loops on his Frog
climbing system snagged just below the lip. As he turned and
reached down to free the loop, he heard a "click" and looked
down at his Croll chest ascender to find that it had
disconnected from the rope. He immediately clipped in to the
anchor rigging with his two cow's tails, and was then able to
free the jammed loop by removing his foot ascender from the
rope and turning around.
James K. Johnson, "Petzl Croll," Cavers Digest #5451, 6
June 1997.
Comments: This incident is worth reporting because it
illustrates the need for redundancy in your climbing system.
When the Croll became unclipped, Johnson was still secured
by the tether from his seat harness to the foot ascender, but
quickly used his cow's tails for backup. Cavers should always
have a cow's tail and/or third ascender for use in such
situations, as well as for negotiating lips, rebelays, and knots
on rope. Ascenders can and do disconnect themselves from
the rope. Slings and buckles sometimes fail. Design your
system to protect against these problems.

********** 7 June
Big Bone Cave, Tennessee
caver fall
Larry Matthews was leading a group of friends on an easy
trip in Big Bone Cave. Several of the cavers were on their first
"wild" caving trip, and Matthews had selected the cave for its
large easy passage and interesting history. They had entered at
about 12:30 p.m. and were approaching the Muster Ground at
about 2:30 p.m. when Ann Caste lost her footing at an 18-inch
step in the passage floor and fell, breaking her ankle.
Two of the others helped her up, but she was unable to
walk, even with their support. Matthews decided to go for
help. Accompanied by one of the other cavers, he exited the
cave, hiked up the mountain to his vehicle, and drove to the
park headquarters, where he reported the accident. Park
officials called the Sheriff to dispatch the county rescue squad.
Matthews returned to the cave, where he met the park
ranger as well as members of the rescue squad and sheriff's
department. The rescuers were not equipped for caving, but
did have emergency medical equipment. Matthews and the
park ranger led them into the cave and to the accident site.
There, they splinted Caste's ankle and began moving her out
of the cave.
They did not have a litter, and wound up fashioning a
substitute using a blanket. That worked for a while, and when
it began to come apart they retrieved a backboard left at the
entrance and used it for the rest of the evacuation. Caste was
out of the cave about four hours after her fall, and was carried
up the hill to an ambulance. She was transported to a hospital
where she had surgery the next day to repair her ankle, which
had been broken in three places.

p. 3.
Comments: Matthews notes that the rescue squad worked
very hard and did a good job, but were hampered by the fact
that they lacked most of the standard equipment for cave
rescue. Once again, it is apparent that cavers and cave rescuers
must work with local rescue squads to increase their
awareness of cave rescue techniques and resources. Also,
when reporting an accident cavers should tell the authorities
about cave rescue teams that may be available in the area and
explain the need for the special equipment and training that
those teams can bring to the effort. Know how to contact cave
rescue teams in your area, and be ready to help local officials
reach them.


********** 7 June
Lawrence Welk Cave, California
caver fall
San Diego Grotto members including John and Cassiopeia
Barlow were leading a group of Boy Scouts (ages 10 to 15) on
an introductory caving trip. A woman named Brenda, who
was the mother of one of the scouts, took a ten-foot fall,

---------- Page 37 ----------
1997 Accident and Incident Reports
twisting her ankle and landing on her back. One of the scouts
was able to slow her fall enough to prevent serious injury, but
she felt pain in her hip and ankle. When she tried to climb
back up to the entrance, she began showing signs of shock.
The cavers sent one of the scouts to retrieve a pack of rescue
equipment they had left at the entrance, and used slings to
help the woman up the climb and out of the cave.
Cassiopeia Barlow, "Lawrence Welk: A Scout Adventure,
San Diego Grotto News, July 1997, v3n10.
Comments: The cavers were wise to have rescue and first
aid equipment available. It would have saved some time if
they'd carried it with them instead of leaving it outside. Shock
is a serious concern in any caving accident, and must be
recognized and treated quickly.


********** 4 July
Lilburn Cave, California
difficulty on cable ladder
Roger Mortimer, Merrilee Profitt, and Glenn Butcher
entered Lilburn Cave in King's Canyon National Park as part
of the ongoing Cave Research Foundation project there. Just
inside the entrance is a 40-foot pit, which was rigged with a
cable ladder and belay line. Butcher had some trouble
descending the ladder. After a short trip checking phone lines,
the group headed out. They stopped for water and a snack
before beginning the ladder climb. Once again, Butcher had
difficulty with the ladder, climbing only five feet on his first
attempt and three feet on the second try. He did not want to
rest on the belay line.
The group considered making the three-hour traverse to
the second entrance, but decided against it due to the distance
and the presence of several exposed areas along the route. The
decided to send for help from cavers staying at the cabin
nearby. Five cavers returned and quickly rigged a haul system
and a separate belay from above. Butcher was hauled up the
first part of the pit, where the ladder hung free, and was able
to climb the last part where it lay against the rock.
Roger Mortimer, Incident report, 19 August 1998.
Comments: Mortimer attributes the incident to
inexperience and poor conditioning. Butcher was on his
second caving trip, and had very limited experience with cable
ladders. Mortimer notes that the group always uses a belay at
the ladder for both ascent and descent, a wise practice.


********** 10 July
Wind-Ice Cave, Wyoming
caver fall
Cindy Budge, John Davidson, Warren Anderson, Ian
Gersten, Keith Benefiel, and several others entered the upper
Ice Cave entrance of the cave on a training trip for members
of the Teton County Search and Rescue Team. They planned
to descend six drops in the Ice Cave section and exit via the
lower Wind Cave entrance. The Wind Cave entrance is
connected to the Ice Cave section at the bottom of the sixth
drop by a small pit which they planned to ascend using a cable
ladder and belay line rigged in advance.
The trip went as planned until they reached a junction near
the bottom of the cave. At that point the group split up, with
Budge, Davidson and Anderson taking a shorter route down
the sixth drop, a 25-foot pit, while Gersten and Benefiel chose
a longer alternate route involving a ten-foot chimney.
The 25-foot drop was not rigged. Anderson, an
experienced caver and one of the original explorers of the
cave, was familiar with it and decided to climb down and
retrieve the belay rope from the nearby cable ladder climb. He
climbed down the drop and up the cable ladder without belay,
removed the rope from the ladder climb, then climbed back
down the ladder and up the 25-foot pit. He then rigged the 25-
foot drop for the others to rappel.
Meanwhile, the group taking the longer bypass route came
to the ten-foot chimney climb. Gersten lost his footing in the
chimney and fell, bruising his back and breaking a finger.
After a short break the group continued down the passage,
arriving at the bottom of the 25-foot pit and the ladder climb.
Budge and Davidson had rappelled the drop and were
waiting for Anderson to de-rig the rope and climb down.
Anderson had instructed them not to climb the cable ladder
until he could reestablish the belay line. Despite this, Budge
climbed the ladder without belay. As she reached the top, she
slipped, lost her grip on the ladder, and fell the entire 20-foot
length of the climb. Budge fell sideways, striking Benefiel,
who had just turned the corner and walked into the area,
unaware of the climber above. He was knocked to the ground
by the impact. Davidson saw her slip, lunged across the room
in an attempt to break her fall, and was also knocked down by
the impact. Budge ultimately landed on a breakdown pile.
Budge broke three ribs, punctured and collapsed one lung,
and sustained various bruises and abrasions in the fall.
Benefiel was stunned by the impact and suffered a knee
injury. Davidson suffered no serious injury.
Moments after the fall, the remainder of the team,
including an EMT, arrived at the scene. After assessing
everyone's condition and treating the obvious injuries, they
determined that Budge and Benefiel could walk out with
assistance. Budge was able to climb back up the ladder, this
time on belay, and exit the cave with some assistance.
Benefiel was able to exit under his own power.
Once out of the cave, Budge felt better and was able to
hike back down to the team base camp. After reaching the
camp, her condition began to deteriorate. She had difficulty
breathing and felt pain in her chest. The team called in a
helicopter to take her to the hospital. The following day
doctors used a chest tube to reinflate her collapsed lung.
Gersten traveled by horse from the camp to the trailhead and
was then driven to the hospital for treatment of his injuries.

Comments: Benefiel notes that all the team members had
been instructed in class not to climb cable ladders without a

belay. He speculates that Budge may have overlooked the rule
after seeing Anderson, a very experienced caver who was not
a rescue team member, "scamper up and down" the climbs.
This serves as yet another reminder that it is not safe to climb
a cable ladder without a belay.
Communication was also a factor, in that a caver walked
into a fall zone just in time to be hit. Team members need to
keep track of who is doing what on a drop, and when the fall
zone is clear for entry.

caver fall
A group of boy scouts was inside the cave near the
entrance when one of the adult leaders fell about 15 or 20 feet.
The group sent for help, and the county rescue squad
responded. The man was able to exit with assistance. No other
information was available.

********** 12 July
Hellhole, West Virginia
caver fall
Ed Devine, Gordon Brace, Lewis Carrol, and Bob
Anderson entered Hellhole at about 10:00 a.m. on Saturday to
explore and survey a lead discovered during an earlier trip.
They rappelled the 150-foot entrance pit and proceeded into
the newly discovered section of the cave, where they
descended another 100-foot pit. After some digging, they
broke through into large passage with many new leads. They
had spent about 11 hours surveying in the new area when
Anderson slipped while climbing up a boulder and fell about
three or four feet. When he landed, he suffered severe
fractures of his lower leg.
The cavers attempted to stabilize Anderson's leg with a
makeshift splint, but the damage was too great, and they could
not make it secure enough for him to try to move through the
cave without causing more internal damage. Devine and Brace
gave their extra clothing and supplies to Anderson and Carrol
and started out to get help. They were several hours travel
from the entrance.
Carrol and Anderson tried to keep warm as they waited.
About 12 hours after the fall, the first rescuers reached the
accident site. A wire mesh splint was applied to stabilize
Anderson's lower leg and foot. The rescuers pointed out that
the passage would be difficult to move a litter through, and
that Anderson would get out a lot faster if he could travel with
assistance rather than being carried. Anderson felt he could do
that, and was ready to go.
For the next several hours, Anderson crawled, hobbled,
and squeezed through the passages with help from rescuers as
needed. He rested often, and his medical condition was
carefully monitored. The two pits were rigged with haul
systems, and fellow cavers quickly pulled him up. He reached
the surface at about 10:45 p.m. on Sunday night and was taken
by ambulance to a nearby hospital.

Comments: There is little doubt that a full carry-out rescue
would have taken much longer. The accident site was over a
mile from the entrance. Several sections of passage were
modified and enlarged to make it easier to get through.
Anderson underwent multiple operations to repair his
damaged leg. Once again, a short fall resulted in severe injury
and a 24-hour ordeal.


********** 16 July
Laurel Caverns, Pennsylvania
bumped head, plus other incidents
A young boy named Matt, approximately 11 years old,
was on a commercially guided trip into the undeveloped
section of Laurel Caverns when he struck his head, causing
minor neck injuries. He was wearing a helmet provided by
Laurel Caverns. The employees leading the trip decided that
he needed to be carried out, and sent word out for a litter and
assistance. About 20 fire and rescue personnel and 30 cave
rescue volunteers responded. The accident site was at the very
back of the cave, and the evacuation took about 3.5 hours.
Doug Moore, Incident report, NCRC Eastern Region web site,
17 July 1997.
Comments: This was reportedly the third incident of the
day at the cave. Earlier, a visitor had suffered a broken ankle
and was able to walk out with assistance. In another incident,
a caver fell and suffered minor injuries. All three incidents
involved different groups touring the cave.


********** 19 July
Sotano de Tapanco, Mexico
rockfall
John and Suzy Pint took a group of cavers including
several novices to the cave for a beginning vertical trip. The
entrance is a hole about three feet by six feet, which opens
into a long fissure. A second, smaller hole nearby offers a
view of the upper part of the 50-foot pit.
The cavers descended the pit without incident and
explored the area at the bottom, finding a second pit that was
choked with rocks. They also noticed a one-inch diameter tree
root which reached from the surface all the way to the bottom
of the pit. One member of the group tugged on the root,
announcing that it almost looked strong enough to climb on.
About an hour later, one of the novice cavers was on rope,
making her first ascent of a pit while John Pint watched
through the skylight above. The climber was about 30 feet off
the floor when a two-foot long, eighteen-inch wide, six-inch
thick block broke loose from the wall about three feet above
her. The climber was able to fend off the rock with her hands,
and it fell toward the three cavers below. Fortunately, they had

---------- Page 39 ----------
1997 Accident and Incident Reports
moved away from the rockfall zone to look at some
formations.
The climber received scraped knuckles on both hands and
bruises on her legs, but was otherwise unharmed. The rock
landed on and damaged the excess rope lying on the floor of
the pit.
John Pint, Incident report, 8 August 1997.
Comments: Pint observes that it had not previously
occurred to him that roots can grow behind huge chunks of
rock in a very solid, stable looking pit and create a life-
threatening hazard. He was not sure whether disturbing the
long root might have loosened the rock, but suggests that such
things be left alone.
The three cavers on bottom had been standing right where
the rock fell until moments before the incident. It is risky to
stand in the rockfall zone of a pit at any time, and is especially
dangerous while someone is on rope. Make it a habit to
quickly get clear of that area and stay out of it whenever
possible. Rockfall is one of the leading causes of accidents
and injury in caving.
July
Boulder Cave, Vermont
rockfall
Kevin O'Classen, Steve Hazelton, Jay Conlin, and Jay's
nephew Patrick had bottomed Boulder Cave and were on their
way out. Conlin climbed up the chute leading to the entrance,
followed by O'Classen who was watching to make sure
Conlin fit through the squeeze. When he saw Conlin safely
out, O'Classen turned and started back down the chute.
Suddenly, the large rock he had been standing on for
several minutes broke loose from the wall, taking several
others with it. O'Classen fell about six feet to a shelf of rock,
and was struck by some of the other rocks during the fall. He
landed on top of the largest rocks, which he estimated at 250-
300 pounds. He was not seriously injured.
Everyone climbed out, taking care to avoid the loose rock
in the center of the chute. A few smaller rocks and some
gravel fell as O'Classen made his exit.

Comments: O'Classen observes that it is fortunate that no
one was underneath him and that the collapse did not occur
when Conlin crossed the rock and he was standing below.

Garrison Cave #2, Missouri
lost, stranded
Jon Beard, Rick Miller, and Victor Foster were surveying
an upstream lead in the cave while three other cavers surveyed
in another area. Miller decided to leave early, and started out
solo. When the rest of the group finished surveying and exited
the cave, they were surprised to find Miller's vehicle still
present.
Part of the group returned to the cave and searched in vain,
covering the entire "old cave" section. The decided to call in
more cavers from their grotto to help with the search. The
second search group repeated the search of the "old cave"
section and then moved into the "new cave," where they soon
found Miller about 500 feet down the passage. He had become
lost on the way out, and had been waiting for seven hours.

********** 30 August
Stephens Gap Pit, Alabama
fatality, caver fall, rappelled off end of rope
Karen Prowett (46), Ricky Rawlins, Terri Rawlins, James
Englett, Ann Englett, Jeff Hearne, and Bonnie Teasley arrived
at the parking area for the cave at about 12:15 p.m. They
planned to spend the afternoon rappelling and climbing in the
143-foot open-air pit entrance. All were experienced cavers,
with the exception of Ann Englett, who was just there to
watch. Most, including Prowett, had done the pit before.
They hiked to the cave where Englett and Ricky Rawlins
began rigging several ropes. A 200-foot rope was rigged on
the waterfall side of the pit for rappelling. A 77-foot rope was
rigged alongside as a "safety rope," with about 35-40 feet of
its length hanging in the pit. The cavers did not tie a knot in
the bottom of the short rope. A 245-foot rope was rigged on
the opposite side of the pit to be used for ascent. After rigging
the ropes, the cavers tried to adjust the long ropes SO that they
had no excess rope on bottom.
Englett was the first to descend on the 200-foot rope.
When he reached the bottom, he noted that the 245-foot rope
was short, and called up to Rawlins to lengthen it. While they
were making the adjustment, Prowett went to the rappel rope
and began to rig for descent. The others were not watching as
she rigged, and no one noticed that she had rigged her rappel
rack onto the 77-foot "safety rope" rather than the 200-foot
rappel line.
At about 1:15 p.m., Prowett backed over the lip on rappel,
pausing to call "Rock!" as several small stones were
dislodged, then began to descend rapidly. When she reached
the end of the short rope there was no knot to stop her from
going off the end of the rope, and she fell about 100 feet to the
bottom of the pit. Englett saw her fall, and rushed over to her.
Hearne, who was trained as a paramedic, quickly climbed
down to the pit bottom via a side entrance. He could not detect
a pulse. Prowett was killed by the impact.
Hearne remained at the bottom while Rawlins went for
help. Emergency personnel responded, and Prowett was
carried out through the lower entrance of the cave.
Terri Rawlins, Incident report, 10 September 1997.
Comments: It is imperative that any rope rigged in a pit or
down a drop first have a knot or loop tied in the end to prevent
this from happening. The short rope was intended for use as a
"safety rope" for the cavers to clip onto while rigging for

---------- Page 40 ----------
1997 Accident and Incident Reports
rappel. Instead, it was improperly rigged and created a
dangerous situation, with tragic results.
Prowett made a mistake in rigging to the wrong rope. She
did not notice the light weight of the short rope, and may not
have paid enough attention during the rigging to be aware that
one rope did not reach bottom. She did not look down to
check the condition of the rope below her before going over
the lip. But these things would have amounted to only a minor
inconvenience if there had been a knot in the end of that rope.
It is every caver's responsibility to inspect and understand
the rigging, and to point out and correct dangerous situations.
This accident was entirely avoidable and should not have
happened.
August
Anhumas Abismo, Brazil
caver fall, harness failure
Bill Rennaker and two cave-diver companions traveled
from Miami to Sao Paulo, Brazil, where they met up with
Brazilian cavers and traveled to Anhumas Abismo, where they
planned to explore a deep underwater pit. The cave entrance is
a 276-foot pit, with about 70 feet of slope above a 200-foot
free drop to a deep pool and submerged passage below. The
Brazilian cavers had explored the cave earlier, reaching a
depth of about 200 feet below the water surface, where they
reported that the tunnel dropped down a deep pit. Rennaker
and companions were equipped with special tanks and gas
mixtures, and planned to dive as deep as 400 feet to explore
the pit.
Rennaker had never rappelled before, but his hosts assured
him that it was simple. They provided him with a harness and
rappelling equipment, and described their use. The harness
was described as "rated at 165 pounds, which gave the 200-
pound Rennaker pause, but his hosts assured him that they had
used it with divers larger than him. He watched carefully as
one of the Brazilians descended. Rennaker then rigged in and
backed over the edge. As he leaned back, he felt himself drop
several inches as his full weight came onto the rope and
harness. He was startled, but then continued his rappel. He
was then surprised by "the over-weighted climbing harness
failing completely and suddenly giving way."
Rennaker found himself falling down the 200-foot drop.
He was wearing leather gloves, grabbed the rope as tightly as
he could, but the rope burned through the gloves and cut into
his hands. He fell the full length of the drop and crashed feet-
first into the pool at the bottom, sending up a huge geyser of
water. After several seconds, Rennaker surfaced, and began
swimming toward a ledge at the side of the pool.
Rennaker had suffered deep abrasions to both hands as he
tried to grip the rope and slow his fall, but had no other
injuries. His companions wanted to exit, but Rennaker vetoed
the idea. His hands were hurting, but the 56-degree water
muted the pain, and he did not want to try to go back up the
rope yet. He decided to go ahead with the planned dive. They
decided that he would signal the others and turn back if his
hands bothered him too much.
The men donned their equipment and followed the dive
line to a depth of 200 feet, where they tied on a new line and
proceeded. They were disappointed when the passage ended at
a depth of 260 feet.
After decompression, the men emerged from the water and
geared up for the climb up the rope. Rennaker's hands were
useless by that point, SO he was hauled up. His hands were
permanently scarred.
Tom Morrisey, "A Pre-dive Dive," Scuba Times, March/April
1998, p. 52.
Comments: It is not clear just how the harness failed or
what was meant by "rated at 165 pounds," but it should be
obvious that the men did not have the proper equipment and
training for a 200-foot pit. Rennaker was quoted as saying,
"I've learned my lesson. I wouldn't cave-dive without training
and I now know better than to rappel without training. I'll get
the right equipment and learn to use it the right way."
Diving with reduced manual dexterity is very hazardous.
People who have been injured often display poor judgement
and their condition may deteriorate suddenly. If this had
occurred during the deep dive, Rennaker (and perhaps one or
more of his companions) could have died. If someone is
injured, aborting the trip should be the default decision.
Summer 1997
Bowden Cave, West Virginia
lost
Cave rescuers were called when a group was reported
overdue in the cave. They were found in the first room, about
100 feet from the entrance, where they had been unable to find
the passage out. No other information was available.

********** 13 September
Sharps Cave, West Virginia
lost
Marshall Holmes and several other cavers entered Sharps
Cave and immediately encountered a poorly-equipped group
exiting the cave. One person in the group had a helmet and
Wheat Lamp, and the others had a few flashlights and no
helmets. They also carried a short length of two-inch manila
rope. Some of their lights had died, and they were having
difficulty with a climb just inside the entrance. Holmes gave
them some help, and spoke with them about caving safety and
proper equipment. The party left the cave, and Holmes' group
continued their trip.
Some time later, Holmes and companions were resting in
Halloween Hall when they heard voices approaching. The
group from the entrance had apparently gone to a nearby
store, bought fresh batteries, and ventured back into the cave.
They were now lost, and could not find their way back to the
entrance.
Holmes and his friends showed the lost cavers the way
back to the upper cave, but the group soon took a wrong turn
in the Entrance Maze and was in danger of becoming lost
once again. Kevin White showed the spelunkers the correct
route while the rest of the cavers exited the cave. Holmes gave

---------- Page 41 ----------

the group another talking-to, and invited them to go caving
with experienced cavers and learn better caving techniques.
Marshall Holmes, "A 'Near Incident' in Sharps Cave," The
West Virginia Caver, December 1997, v15n6, p. 13.
Comments: Holmes was certain that a rescue would have
resulted had his group not been there to lead the spelunkers
out from the Halloween Room. They were wandering in
circles and would soon have exhausted their batteries and
become stranded.


********** 26 October

caver fall
A group of teenagers was exploring the cave when a girl
fell about eight feet and broke her arm. Three of her
companions left the cave to get sticks to make a splint. At the
entrance, they encountered a group of cavers entering the
cave. When they heard of the accident, two of the cavers went
to assist while two others went to a nearby house and called
911. The cavers helped the girl out of the cave, reaching the
entrance just as emergency response personnel were arriving.
Robert W. Jones, Incident report, 9 November 1997.
Comments: The teenagers did not have proper caving
equipment. The injured girl was wearing a baseball cap, and
her partner was wearing a bicycle helmet.


********** 1 November
Fern Cave, Alabama
difficulty on rope
While on a trip to descend the 404-foot drop in Surprise
Pit, a caver (32) became stuck just below the lip when she
could not get the rope to feed through her rack. She was
reportedly afraid of heights, and had tried to go over on her
knees. She slid down the slope and wound up with her rack
pinned at the lip. She became concerned, and did not want to
continue the descent, but did not feel comfortable making a
changeover on rope to climb back up. Scott Fee was able to
attach two ascenders with long slings above the stranded
caver, allowing her to climb back up over the lip. The group
then left the cave.
Scott Fee, Incident report, 11 January 1998.
Comments: Fee notes that a modification in the rigging
would have made the lip easier to cross. It is alarming that a
caver who is afraid of heights and feels uncomfortable doing a
changeover on rope would contemplate doing a 400-foot pit.
Cavers should perfect their technique on smaller drops before
attempting the big ones. Things feel very different when you
have the weight of 400 feet of rope hanging below.


********** 1 November
Illinois Caverns, Illinois
caver fall
Mark Jones was leading seven students on a novice caving
trip when one of the girls tripped on the sharp lip of a pothole
in the stream passage and twisted her leg. She immediately
went down, and was in obvious pain. They decided that she
would need assistance getting out. They were about one-
hour's travel from the entrance, SO Jones sent three boys out to
get help.
After they left, Jones stabilized the injured girl's leg by
strapping it to her other leg with two belts. Then they began
carrying her toward the entrance, taking turns to let everyone
rest. After about 45 minutes, the girl began to get cold, SO
Jones covered her with a thermal blanket. On the way out they
were met by Marc Tiritilli, a caver who had been leading
another group touring the cave. He had encountered the three
boys on their way out, and had come to help. Soon after that,
volunteer firemen began to arrive. They had been called by
the park ranger after the boys told him of the accident.
The firemen had brought in a wire Stokes litter. They
placed the injured girl in the litter, using coats for padding.
Working together, the cavers and firemen carried the litter
through the cave and out the entrance. An ambulance was
waiting outside and transported the girl to the hospital, where
her injury was diagnosed as a strained ligament.
Mark Jones, "Illinois Caverns Rescue - November 1, 1997,"
Mark Twain Grotto Echoes, February 1998, v5n1, p. 2.
Comments: Jones notes that as a result of the rescue he
now carries in his pack several items that he would have
found useful on the trip, including: a better first aid kit; a long
section of one-inch tubular webbing; extra batteries; a plastic
trash bag (in addition to the thermal blanket); extra gloves;
and a hat. He also observes that "the NCRC training proved
invaluable to the two experienced cavers leading the rescue"
and recommends the training to all rescue personnel in cave
areas. The fire department was not well equipped for the cave.
Cavers could help them obtain better equipment and training.


********** 2 November
Fern Cave, Alabama
fatality, caver fall, lost control on rappel
David Cole (24), Jennifer Foote (23), Alexia Hampton
(35), Reid Hampton (40), Lane Purser (54), and Lynn Purser
(44) entered the Fern Sink entrance of Fern Cave at about
11:00 a.m., planning to descend a 404-foot drop in Surprise
Pit. A sizeable waterfall was pouring into the entrance sink as
a result of the previous day's rainfall. They climbed down into
the sink and made their way through 800 feet of narrow
stream passage to the Waiting Room, where the stream drops
into the 437-foot shaft.
The 404-foot rig point is reached by crawling through a
slot along the wall and traversing an exposed ledge around the
pit for about 30 feet to a natural bridge across the pit. There
are several possible rig points, and the group chose the most
frequently used one, located at the far end of the bridge, well

---------- Page 42 ----------
1997 Accident and Incident Reports
away from the waterfall. Several bolts in the wall provide
anchors for the drop.
Cole rigged a line across the ledge traverse SO that
everyone could remain clipped in while moving out to the
bridge. He then rigged the pit with a new 600-foot caving
rope. He also rigged a short rope in the pit for assistance in
crossing the lip or taking photographs. Both ropes had knots
tied in their ends. Cole reminded everyone that the long rope
was brand new, and would therefore be slick and likely to
give a fast rappel.
Cole decided to remain on top until the others went down.
Foote had little vertical experience, and did not plan to do the
pit. Lynn Purser rappelled first, followed by Lane Purser and
then Reid Hampton. None experienced any problem
descending. The area at the bottom of the pit was windy and
cold, with lots of spray and mist from the waterfall. The rope
landed partway up a tall breakdown slope known as
Cuddingtons Cairn. As the cavers got off rope, they moved up
the slope to get out of the rockfall zone and watch the next
person descend. They did not use bottom belays.
Alexia Hampton went next. She was an experienced
vertical caver and had done many pits, including several over
100 feet deep and two pits over 200 feet deep. This was her
first trip to Surprise Pit, and her first pit over 250 feet deep.
Hampton rigged in using five stainless steel bars of her
six-bar rappel rack. She did not ask for or receive a belay, and
did not use any self-belay device. Hampton eased over the
edge and began her descent without difficulty. Cole watched
as she descended the first 200 feet.
Reid Hampton and the Pursers watched the rappel from
below. Everything appeared normal until Alexia was about 50
feet from the bottom. At that point, they heard her cry out, and
saw her fall as she lost control of her rappel. She struck the
floor with a violent impact, tearing one boot from her foot,
and sustaining compound fractures of her lower left leg as
well as other injuries. She was knocked unconscious by the
impact. The time was 1:15 p.m.
The others rushed down to her, fearing from the sound that
she must be dead. She was still breathing, however, and
regained consciousness after a few minutes. She was in severe
pain from her injuries, and complained of pain in her left
femur, as well as in her abdomen.
At the top, Cole heard Hampton's cry, followed by a loud
impact as she stuck bottom. There were more cries from the
bottom. He then heard Lynn Purser calling to him to go for
help, but felt he needed to know what had happened before
doing SO. He waited a few minutes, and heard Lane Purser call
for him to come down quickly.
Cole rigged in and went to the bottom. Hampton was
conscious by this time, and aware of her situation. The cavers
moved her carefully away from the rope to a flat spot about
three feet away. They covered her with an emergency blanket,
and Cole started out for help. He climbed out of the pit as
quickly as he could and left the cave with Foote following.
After running down the mountain to the vehicles, he used
Foote's cell phone to call a cave rescue team member in
Huntsville. He then called the county Sheriff's office and
reported the accident.
Cole then took a sleeping bag, backpacking stove, and
another emergency blanket and went back to the cave and
down the pit. Hampton was covered with the sleeping bag and
blanket. Lane Purser went out for more sleeping bags while
the others remained with Hampton. At about 4:45, Cole
climbed out to look for Purser and the sleeping bags. He
found Purser just arriving at the pit, ready to take the bags
down to Reid Hampton and Lynn Purser, who were becoming
cold.
Shortly after, rescuers began to arrive at the pit. Cole
explained the situation, and he and Foote went outside to
answer questions and help brief the rescuers. Cave rescue
teams from Alabama, Tennessee, and Georgia worked through
the night to bring Hampton out. Two EMT's were sent down
the pit to care for her as she was placed in a litter and hauled
up the 404-foot pit. She was then carefully moved across the
exposed ledge traverse around the pit and into the Waiting
Room.
Rescuers carried her through the narrow stream passage,
reaching the bottom of the entrance sink at about 1:00 a.m.
Just as rescuers were about to move her through the entrance,
Hampton stopped breathing. She was quickly passed up out of
the sink to the surface, where medical personnel tried to
revive her. They were unsuccessful. It is believed that she died
from internal injuries and bleeding. She survived for almost
12 hours after the fall.
1. John Van Swearingen IV, "Analysis of the Tragedy at Fern
Cave, Alabama, NSS News, May 1998, v56n5, p. 146.
2. David Cole, "Accident in Fern Cave," Southport Digs,
November/December 1997, v3n13, p. 11.
Comments: Hampton had sufficient training and
experience to safely do the pit. She had the proper equipment.
No one knows why she lost control of the rappel only 50 feet
from the bottom. Some of those involved in the trip and
ensuing rescue operation believe that she was probably struck
by a falling rock or clump of mud, which could have stunned
her and caused her to lose control.
When she struck bottom, her rack was still attached to the
rope with five bars. Her right hand had blisters under her
glove, indicating that she tried to grip the rope to regain
control during the fall. She did not know or was not able to
tell her companions what caused the fall.
It is very important to realize that free-hanging rope
weight reduces as one rappels down a deep pit. This makes a
big difference in the amount of friction that a rack produces. A
caver may have to remove bars at the top of a drop in order to
move, then add bars towards the bottom of the drop to get
more friction.
At the top of Surprise Pit, Hampton would have had about
25 pounds of rope beneath her. At 50 feet above the floor, she
would have had about 3 pounds. This is a large difference, and
it can be very difficult to jam the bars upward hard enough to
compensate. Because Hampton had not previously done a
drop of this length, she may not have been aware of this
phenomenon or may have forgotten it.
If a bar cannot be added, an emergency technique is to
quickly wrap the rope around a leg by spinning the ankle
around the rope. This may cause severe burns, but is
preferable to an out of control rappel. The technique requires

---------- Page 43 ----------
1997 Accident and Incident Reports
both practice and awareness that the hazard can occur at the
end of a long drop.
Hampton's fall might have been prevented, stopped, or at
least slowed by a bottom belay or a self-belay device. Cavers
should give serious thought to this incident and to their own
safety procedures in pits.


********** 22 November
Laurel caverns, Pennsylvania
caver fall
Tim Billek (20) was exploring Laurel Caverns with six
other college students on a trip led by experienced caver John
Chenger. At about 1:00 p.m. Billek stepped into a shallow
pothole in the packed sand floor and fell, injuring his left
ankle. He was unable to bear weight on the ankle, which was
very painful. They decided to wait a few minutes to see if the
pain subsided.
After about ten minutes, Billek's ankle was splinted with a
SAM splint and wrapped with duct tape. Chenger and other
members of the party began helping Billek out of the cave,
with assistance from a group of boy scouts who were on a
separate trip. The route to the entrance was about 1,400 feet
long with over 300 feet of elevation to gain.
Once the group had Billek moving, Chenger went ahead to
the Ballroom where a telephone is located. He called out to
the surface and requested help. When he returned to the
group, he found that Billek was moving more quickly than
expected, and was able to exit the cave largely under his own
power. No further assistance was needed.

unidentified sinkhole, British Columbia, Canada
caver fall
Dick Garnick, Mike Fraley, and Larry McTigue were
trying to locate a large sinkhole reported to the Canadian
Ministry of Forests by a timber cruiser. It was said to be
taking a stream and blowing cold air when it was discovered.
They had good directions and a map, and found the sink
without difficulty. It was about 50 feet in diameter and 25 feet
deep.
McTigue started down into the sink to look for cave at the
bottom. As he made his way down the steep slope, he reached
for a handhold on the rocks. What appeared to be a solid part
of the bedrock rim of the sink turned out to be a loose block
held only by dirt and moss. The instant McTigue put his
weight on it, the rock came loose. He fell about six feet to a
ledge, landed on his feet, and pitched headfirst into the sink,
with the 100-pound rock in pursuit. After tumbling another 15
feet down the 45-degree slope, McTigue was struck in the
back by the rock. The blow sent him sliding another six feet
headfirst into a pile of rubble at the bottom of the sink.
McTigue was lying head down at a 45-degree angle. He
moved to right himself from the uncomfortable position. The
pain was SO severe that he thought at first that the boulder had
broken his spine. He was able to move his arms and legs, and
able to turn over and sit upright. His glasses had been lost in
the fall, and he could not see.
Fraley heard the fall and came to help. He located
McTigue's glasses, and helped make him more comfortable as
he rested and tried to regain his composure. Garnick arrived,
and when McTigue felt ready, the other two helped him try to
climb up out of the sink. The pain was intense, and McTigue
didn't think he was going to be able to make the climb.
Garnick decided to go for help while Fraley stayed with
McTigue.
After more rest, and with assistance from Fraley, McTigue
was eventually able to climb out of the sink. It was getting
late, and the two men did not want to spend the night out in
the cold waiting for help, SO they began making their way
back to the vehicles several miles away. After a five-hour
ordeal, they were met by rescuers on the ridge above the
parking area. McTigue was taken to a hospital, where he was
treated and released.

Morrells Cave, Tennessee
caver fall
Mark Ankers (16) was a beginning caver on his first trip
with a local grotto. He was wearing a construction type hard
hat with no chinstrap and carrying a hand-held flashlight.
About one hour into the trip he was crossing a tilted slab
when he lost his footing and slid out of control about ten feet
down the 50-degree slope. He received a cut across the bridge
of his nose and injured his leg and his head. His glasses were
broken in the fall, and probably caused the cut on his nose.
One of the cavers had a first aid kit, and was able to clean and
bandage the cut. The glasses were repaired with duct tape.
Ankers exited the cave without further assistance.
Ted Durney, Incident report, 1 February 1998.
Comments: The trip was a grotto trip led by NSS
members, but Ankers was not properly equipped. Durney
notes that Ankers had good footwear, but that his use of the
hand-held flashlight prohibited the use of one of his hands to
arrest his fall. The cheap hard hat was also not a good idea. As
NSS members, are we not obligated to make sure the people
we take caving are properly equipped and trained?

bad air
David Cole (24) and Lane Purser (53) entered a cave in the
bottom of a large sink. The cave takes a large amount of water
and large amounts of organic debris are found in certain areas.
After a series of climbdowns, they descended a 21-foot pit.
Several hundred feet later they came to a 27-foot pit. While
setting a bolt at the top, Cole began to feel overheated.
After rappelling to the bottom, both Cole and Purser began
sweating profusely and had difficulty breathing. A lighter
would not light at the bottom of the pit, suggesting a low
oxygen level. They decided to exit the cave. Cole spent the
longer time on bottom, and felt lightheaded even after
climbing back up. He had difficulty standing and walking, and
wound up crawling the next 1,000 feet at a very slow pace.

Comments: See the December 1997 issue of American
Caving Accidents for a description of the "Bic test" for bad

Larry Church, Richard Blackburn, and four other cavers
were exploring Tom Pack Cave when they came to a climb-up
about 500 feet into the cave. As Church started up, a ledge he
was standing on broke off and he fell about two feet to the
floor. As he fell he grabbed at the ceiling to stop the fall,
dislocating his shoulder in the process. He landed on the
injured shoulder, breaking the ball joint at the top of his arm.
Blackburn went ahead to another group of cavers who
were surveying to let them know what had happened and get
some webbing. The cavers used the webbing to make a sling
and immobilize Church's injured arm. Church was able to exit
the cave with a little assistance from the group at climbs. He
was taken to a hospital for treatment.

illness
Charlie Cole was with a large group of cavers touring

became anxious in the crawl, and backed out. He was
sweating profusely and having difficulty breathing. Eric
Anderson helped him away from the crawl and sat with him as
he rested.
David Anderson and several other cavers soon arrived and
asked if they needed help. It was quickly apparent that Cole
was both deaf and unable to speak. Using notes, he indicated
that he was feeling ill, had chest pain, was on medication, and
needed assistance to leave the cave.
After some rest, the other cavers stayed with Cole as he
started out. He lost his breath easily and had to be pulled up
two short climbs. The trip back to the entrance took about an
hour. Once outside, Cole recovered his composure. He told
the others that he'd had two heart attacks previously.

********** 14 March
Clarksville Cave, New York
rockfall
Mike Nardacci and Bryan Robinson were leading a group
of scouts on a trip to the cave. Both men had led many such
trips at the cave over the years. Nardaccci and seven scouts
entered at about 10:30 a.m., followed by Robinson and the
remainder of the group. As the second group made its way
down the steeply sloping entrance, a large boulder broke loose
from the wall and slid down the slope toward the scouts
below.
Robinson saw the boulder start to slide, and rushed
forward to get one boy out of the way. He managed to push
the boy to safety, but was struck by the boulder and
momentarily pinned. As it settled into a more stable position
Robinson was freed, but the impact caused injuries including a
dislocated shoulder, broken arm, and broken thumb. The
boulder came to rest in a precarious position at the top of a
slippery slope leading down into the Big Room where other
scouts were waiting at the base of the entrance climb.
A sling was fashioned from the straps of a cave pack, and
Robinson was able to climb back out of the entrance on his
own. After making sure that the boulder was stable, the adults
escorted all the scouts out of the cave. Robinson was taken to
a hospital for surgery to repair his broken arm and shoulder.
Mike Nardacci, "Clarksville Cave Accident, 'Northeastern
Caver, March 1998, p. 8.
Comments: Local cavers went to the cave later that
afternoon and pushed the boulder the rest of the way down
into the entrance SO that it presented no further danger. An
investigation the following day determined that the boulder
weighed approximately 1,400 pounds. The boulder had
appeared to be a solid section of bedrock. Nardacci and others
suspected that repeated freezing and thawing of water in
surrounding cracks had loosened it. Temperatures during the
previous week had been very cold, following a period of
warm, wet weather.
As Nardacci writes in his report, "Bryan is a very good
caver who performed heroically at the time of the incident.
Had he not rushed forward, the scout might have been hit and
severely injured. What might have happened if the boulder
had not lodged where it did is far too unpleasant to think
about."

They had been in the cave before, and had been stopped by a
30-foot pit. This time they came equipped with a knotted 3/8-
inch nylon line obtained from a hardware store.
The boys traversed over 1,400 feet of tight, wet canyon
and stream passage to get to the pit. They anchored the rope at
the top, and Cunningham attempted to descend hand-over-
hand. He could not hold on to the thin rope, and began to

slide, burning his hands. When he lost his grip, he fell to the
bottom and injured his leg. Lawyer left him some extra
clothing and went out to call for help.
Authorities were contacted at 6:00 p.m. and called in cave
rescuers, who arrived at 7:15 p.m. The first rescuers reached
the pit at about 8:00 p.m. Anmar Mirza rigged a proper caving
rope, descended the pit, and found Cunningham stranded, but
not seriously injured. The sediments at the bottom of the pit
had broken his fall, and he suffered only a sprained ankle.
Cunningham was fitted with a splint, which was padded
and secured with duct tape to form a sort of "walking cast."
Mirza outfitted Cunningham with a Texas climbing system
and held him out of the waterfall as he climbed the pit.
Rescuers helped Cunningham over the lip and escorted him
out of the cave. He reached the surface at 10:15 p.m. and was
taken to the hospital by his parents.

********** 25 April
Hanors Cave, New York
stranded
George Allen, Chris Nicola, and Bob Cohen planned to do
an entrance-to-entrance through-trip in Hanors Cave. The trip
involves some difficult chimneys and a tight squeeze where
the passage connects to the bottom of the Cave
Disappointment entrance pit. They decided it would be easier
to go in the Hanors entrance and rappel or down-climb the
chimneys, then climb out the 50-foot pit at the Cave
Disappointment entrance.
They rigged the 50-foot drop at the Disappointment
entrance, then entered the Hanors entrance, using another rope
as a rappel line at a 12-foot chimney. When they reached the
squeeze opening into the room at the bottom of the entrance
pit, Allen discovered that he could not fit through the crack.
They returned to the chimney, where they found it very
difficult to climb back up, even with the rope hanging down.
The rope was in a narrow part of the crack and they could not
use their ascenders to climb it. By standing on Allen's
shoulders, Cohen was able to get up. But after repeated
attempts, neither Allen nor Nicola could get up the climb.
Allen suggested that they go get some help from other
cavers known to be nearby. Nicola returned to the Cave
Disappointment entrance, went through the squeeze, and
climbed out of the pit. On the surface he met Cohen, who had
exited via the Hanors entrance.
The two rounded up some cavers and additional equipment
and went back to rig the chimney for Allen. They used a
crowbar wedged across the top of the chimney to redirect the
rope out of the narrow part of the crack SO that Allen could
use his ascending gear to climb up. He was soon out, and the
cavers exited without further incident.
George Allen, "Assistance in Hanors Cave," Northeastern
Caver, June 1998, p. 44.
Comments: If you're not sure you can get through, it is
wise to rig in such a way that you are sure you can get back
out the way you came in. This is a nice example of the use of
other nearby cavers to effect a quick rescue using a minimum
of resources.

Tim Marlett was leading a group of four cavers including
Troy Wilber (12) on a survey trip in the cave when they
encountered a bat flying in the ten-foot tall canyon passage.
Marlett pointed out the bat, and the group continued its survey
work.
The next day, Wilber told Marlett that he had a wound on
his hand and that he thought it was a bite from the bat. Marlett
thought that the wound appeared to be an abrasion, and was
more likely due to one of the many squeezes in the cave, but
advised Troy to see a doctor immediately. The doctor
examined him and administered the required series of rabies
shots.
Tim Marlett, Incident report, 7 May 1998.
Comments: Wilber was on his very first caving trip. He
claimed that the bat brushed his hand, but denied making any
motion toward the bat. Marlett felt that the boy may have been
frightened and lifted his hand for protection, accidentally
contacting the bat. Since they could not be sure, the rabies
treatment was necessary.

illness
Larry Matthews was leading a trip to the Great Extension
section of the cave when he began feeling weak, dizzy, and
over-heated. He was having trouble with his new caving light,
and one boot was coming apart. He decided that he could not
continue the trip, and told the others that he needed to go out.
Two members of the group helped him back to the
commercial tour trail, where he told them that he would rest a
while and then make his way out. He felt he would be OK by
himself and told them to go on and continue their trip.
After resting, Matthews started out, but had a hard time on
his own. He eventually made it out and back to the ticket
office, where he rested and drank two bottles of water. It took
him about two hours to recover.
Larry Matthews, "Self Rescue (Sort-Of) in Cumberland
Caverns, TAG-Net #1448, 25 May 1998.
Comments: Matthews felt that the illness was probably due
to the fact that he takes medication to control his blood
pressure, and that the prescription had recently been changed.
He had experienced a similar problem 18 months earlier on
his first caving trip after starting medication for the condition.
He had been exercising regularly before the trip, and did not
anticipate any problem.

lost, stranded, inadequate equipment
A group of five adults (ages 21 to 40) and one child (9)
entered the cave at about 3:00 p.m. on May 24. They wore
lightweight clothing, with some wearing only shorts, T-shirts,
and tennis shoes. They did not have helmets or other proper
caving equipment. When they failed to return to their
campsite, family members called authorities and reported the
group overdue. The State Police and Illinois Emergency
Management Agency requested the assistance of the
Department of Natural Resources Mine Inspectors Rescue
Team early on the morning of May 25.
At about 6:30 a.m., the mine rescue team arrived at the
cave, where state police and other emergency services
personnel were waiting. After interviewing family members
for information about the missing group, the rescuers hiked to
the entrance equipped with helmets and lights and carrying
first aid supplies. They also carried a 1,000-foot lifeline.
They reached the cave entrance at 7:10 a.m. and entered
the cave, unfurling the lifeline as they went. They followed
what appeared to be the main route, calling out to the lost
party and listening for any response. As they neared the end of
the lifeline, they heard an answer to their calls. They found the
lost group about 150 feet away, huddled together on a ledge.
The batteries had run out on three of their five lights. They
were suffering from mild hypothermia, but were otherwise
unharmed. Rescuers led the group out of the cave.
Liz Pensonau, "They Were at the End of Their Rope,"
Outdoor Illinois, July 1998, p. 7.
Comments: The spelunkers entered without proper
equipment and training for safe caving. Each caver should
carry three sources of light, each one adequate to permit a safe
exit from the cave. The primary caving light (at a minimum)
should be mounted on the helmet to leave the hands free. They
should also have been wearing helmets, and carrying some
food, water, and extra clothing. Shorts, T-shirts, and sneakers
were not appropriate caving attire for this cave.
The rescuers also could have used some training in cave
rescue techniques. What would they have done if the lost
party had been 2,000 or 5,000 feet back in the cave instead of
1,000 feet? The use of "lifelines," while standard in industrial
rescue operations, is usually not practical in cave rescue.

party in the cave. The missing individuals were quickly found
wandering in circles in the lower cave. It was reported that
they had been consuming alcoholic beverages.

they were actually lost.


********** 13 June
Bowden Cave, West Virginia
flooding, brief entrapment
Thirteen cavers entered the cave via the main entrance for
a survey trip, while another group went to survey at the Bear
Heaven entrance. The first group went up the Watercourse,
then split into four teams. After surveying for a while, the
team in the stream passage noted the water rising and
becoming louder.
After some discussion, they decided to have all four teams
meet near the Pendant Room. Two flashlight cavers also
appeared, and announced that the Watercourse was
impassable due to high water. The group contemplated trying
to make their way to the third entrance, but decided that it was
a long trip and they were not sure they could find the route.
They decided to monitor the water level and wait until it
dropped enough to let them go back out the main entrance.

---------- Page 48 ----------
1998 Accident and Incident Reports
Some of the cavers waited at the rendezvous area, while
others passed the time surveying. The water level dropped a
few inches each hour. Eventually, they decided it had fallen
enough to attempt the Watercourse. They water was chest-
deep and strong in the passage, and some of the cavers had
difficulty hanging on. One caver lost her grip in the last ten
feet of the passage and was flushed out under water. The rest
of the group made it back through and all exited via the main
entrance.
The teams working in the Bear Heaven entrance area
reportedly heard "a wall of water" coming and made a quick
exit ahead of the flood.
Pauline Apling, "Bowden Cave Trip, June 13, 1998, West
Virginia Caver, August 1998, p. 15.
Comments: There had been thunderstorms and heavy rain
the night before. It rained heavily for two and a half hours
after the cavers entered the cave. Apling recommends paying
close attention to the weather forecast before venturing into
this cave. That's good advice for all stream caves.

Bartons Cave, Pennsylvania
caver fall
A caver fell somewhere beyond the Mail Slot and was
injured, requiring evacuation. Several rescue groups were
reported to have responded, but no details were available.

********** 18 July
Keyhole Cave, New York
stuck in crevice
Craig Douglas (24), Buster Miller, Jennifer Russell, and
Jessica Douglas entered Keyhole Cave at about 11:00 a.m.
Saturday morning. They had been to the cave the previous
year, and had returned hoping to bottom the cave this time.
The cave is 113 feet deep, contains several small pits and
climbdowns, and is body-tight for most of its 370-foot length.
The bottom is reached by descending an eight-foot pit opening
from a tight crevice in a one-foot high crawl.
Douglas and his companions made their way down
through the cave without incident until they arrived at Paul's
Pipe, the tight crawl leading to the final pit. Douglas crawled
through to the top of the pit to examine and rig the drop. As he
slid his legs through the crevice, he found that one foot was
restricting the movement of his other leg. When he moved that
foot, his right leg became jammed in the crevice. His knee was
caught by a constriction in the bedrock walls.
Douglas spent about 15 minutes trying to free his leg, with
some assistance from Miller. As he became tired, he realized
that he needed to focus on getting back into an upright
position SO that he was not left hanging head-down over the
pit. He managed to turn his leg enough to right himself, but
was still stuck. They realized that they would need tools and
assistance, SO Russell was sent out to call for help.
At about 4:00 p.m., Russell reached the home of Emily
Davis Mobley, the property manager. She told Mobley what
had happened, and Mobley notified authorities and started the
rescue callout. Mobley then sent Russell and another caver
back to the cave with food and supplies for Douglas, and
instructions to try to keep him warm and get him into a stable,
horizontal position.
A large-scale rescue developed, eventually involving more
than 100 people. The tight cave passage kept some cavers
from even entering the cave, SO small cavers were recruited
from across the region. They worked through the night and all
day Sunday trying to free Douglas, with little progress. The
efforts were hampered by the narrow crevice, and rescuers
could only work with one hand at a time. They used drills and
later an air chisel to chip away at the walls on either side of
Douglas' knee.
Hypothermia was a serious threat, as Douglas could not
move around to keep warm. Rescuers placed a carpet under
his hips and legs and wrapped his torso in a space blanket to
try to protect him from the cold, wet rock. An electrical line
was installed and used to power a heat gun, as well as drilling
equipment.
During the night, rescuers noticed that people were
beginning to have trouble breathing while working in the
lower regions of the cave. An oxygen monitor was brought in,
and they found that the oxygen level was down to 16.9% at
one point. They suspected that the breathing difficulty was
being caused by a buildup of carbon dioxide in the cave. A
ventilation system was rigged to blow fresh air through hoses
down to the bottom of the cave.
After many hours of work, Douglas was able to move his
leg, but still could not pull it free from the crevice. Eventually,
he was able to take the drill himself and work from below
while hanging into the pit. At about 8:30 p.m. Sunday evening
he was finally able to pull his leg out of the crack. Rescuers
helped him back out of the crawl and into a small room where
he was given food and water and allowed to rest.
Douglas was exhausted from his entrapment and the
struggle. The circulation in his right leg had been impaired for
over 30 hours. After several hours rest, he started making his
way back to the surface at about 1:00 a.m. Monday morning.
He needed assistance from rescuers at the climbs and pits, but
had to move himself through much of the tight passage. He
reached the surface at about 9:15 a.m. Monday morning.
Douglas was taken by ambulance to the hospital, where he
received a fasciotomy (a longitudinal incision on both sides of
his calf) to relieve pressure due to swelling, improve
circulation, and allow removal of dead tissue. The first
incision was closed on 22 July, and the second was closed on
27 July after the swelling subsided.

Comments: Douglas spent about 43 hours in the cave. It
was fortunate that the distance to the entrance was short

1998 Accident and Incident Reports
enough to allow rescuers to run power and air lines into the
cave. Hypothermia was a major concern, not only for
Douglas, but also for some of the rescuers who were in the
cave for long periods. Rescuers also installed a bolt and used
ropes attached to Douglas' harness to help support him and
keep him upright.
The decision to allow Douglas to rest before exiting gave
him some recovery time before the strenuous trip out. It would
have been extremely difficult, if not impossible to carry him
out in a litter.


********** 18 July
Moaning Cavern, California
caver fall, lost control on rappel
Moaning Cavern is a commercial cave which offers
rappelling as a high adventure experience. Vittoria Bossi (32)
had been to the cave twice before to rappel the 180-foot pit
entrance. These two visits, the most recent being in 1994,
were her only experience with rappelling.
Bossi was fitted with a harness and rappel device, and
employees helped her rig for the rappel at the top of the pit.
As she backed down towards the lip, she felt that something
was not right, and that the rappel was "going too fast." She
called up for help, but no one heard her. She was near the lip
where the drop breaks into a 120-foot free-fall. She decided
that "it was just my own fear" because she had not rappelled
in four years, and talked herself into continuing.
As she went over the lip and her full weight came onto the
rappel rack, she lost control and fell. She held onto the rope
below the rack and tried to pull on it as she had been told, but
was unable to slow her descent. An employee waiting at the
bottom of the drop pulled on the rope to give a bottom belay.
Bossi struck the cave wall and then landed on the bottom,
fracturing her skull, two vertebrae in he neck, and one ankle.
The employee kept her from sitting up, and made her lie
still while help was summoned. Emergency personnel were
called, and cavern employees worked with the mountain
search and rescue team to place her in a litter and carry her
back up the long spiral staircase and out of the cave. She was
taken by helicopter to a hospital for treatment. She was
expected to make a full recovery.
1. Scott Mobley, "Rescuers race clock to save caver,
Calaveras Enterprise, 24 July 1998, p. Al.
2. Scott Mobley, "Injured caver blames rigging for accident,"
Calaveras Enterprise, 7 August 1998, p. Al.
Comments: It was not clear from the reports just what kind
of rappel device Bossi was using. It is described several times
as a "pulley device," which sounds like a bobbin-type
descender, but later is mentioned as having "rungs," which is
more suggestive of a rappel rack.
Either way, it appears clear that the rappel device was not
providing enough friction, and that Bossi did not understand
its operation well enough to adjust it. There was also some
confusion as to whether or not the cavern employees were
bottom-belaying the rappel from the beginning, or whether
someone rushed over to apply a belay after the fall started.
Given her lack of experience, Bossi should have been belayed
from above or below. It also appears that proper rappel signals
were not used.
Bossi's spinal fractures were in the same location as those
suffered by actor Christopher Reeve. She felt that by keeping
her from moving or trying to sit up, the employees who helped
her saved her from paralysis or death. In a fall like this, spinal
injuries are very likely, and it is best to send for trained
medical personnel and not move the victim unless his or her
life is in immediate danger.
A 180-foot pit is not an appropriate place to teach
rappelling or to provide outdoor adventure experiences for
tourists. Beginning rappellers should be belayed - the bottom
belay is very useful for this. All rappellers should understand
how their equipment works, how to increase and decrease
friction, and how to avoid or stop an out of control descent.


********** 23 July
Dislocation Cave, Alaska
caver fall
William Curry and eight other cavers finished up a survey
trip in this newly discovered cave on Kosciusco Island and
were climbing out the entrance. Curry was climbing up the
seven-foot entrance climb using an "arm bar" maneuver when
his right leg slipped, throwing his weight unexpectedly onto
his right shoulder and causing dislocation of the shoulder joint
as he fell.
The other cavers helped Curry out of the entrance and
immobilized his arm and shoulder using a cloth sling,
hemlock branches, and a backpack frame. They cleared a path
for him as he hiked back to the vehicles, then drove him back
to camp. Boat transportation to the nearest town was arranged,
and he was driven from there to the hospital in Craig, where
his shoulder was set and treated. The journey took over nine
hours.
William Curry, Incident report, 4 November 1998.


********** 26 July
Blue Spring Cave, Tennessee
slipped, near miss at pit
Jeanne Kell was in a group of cavers touring the cave. The
route required traversing around the edge of a pit using a rope
anchored to the wall. The pit has a flowstone lip described as
"two-and-a-half to three feet wide, and very slippery." On the
way in, the group crossed without incident. On the way out,
however, everyone had wet boots, and the flowstone was even
more slippery. Kell was almost across when she slipped. She
kept her grip on the rope, and was steadied by another caver
who was close enough to grab her. They made their way out
without further incident.
Pete Kinsey, "Caver Makes a Big Splash, Blue Springs Cave
Trip," Spencer Mountain Grotto Mud & Rope, v3n8&9, p. 4.
Comments: This incident is included as a reminder. If
there is enough danger to warrant installing a traverse line,
cavers should probably clip in while crossing. All it takes is a
carabiner and some tubular webbing - items that should
probably be in every caver's pack anyway.

Big Four Ice Caves, Washington
fatality, ice fall
Catherine Shields (27) was killed when an arch of ice and
snow two to four feet thick and six to eight feet wide
collapsed and fell on her at the entrance to a large ice cave on
Big Four Mountain. Shields had hiked up to the cave with
family members to show them the cave. As she walked
beneath the arch, it collapsed, burying her in blocks of snow
and ice. She suffered broken bones, internal injuries, and a
skull fracture, and died at the scene.

Everett Herald, 3 August 1998.
2. Chris Solomon and David Berger, "Woman dies at Big
Four Ice Caves, Seattle Times, 3 August 1998.
Comments: The cave is a very popular destination for
hikers, and has been the site of several such accidents,
including one on July 25, 1996 reported earlier in this issue.
There was another incident, previously unreported, in October
1995, in which a section of the cave collapsed on a woman
named Giovanna Benfro (28). She escaped with cuts to her
head. The entrance was posted with warning signs after the
1996 incident. This was the first recorded fatality at the cave.


********** 8 August
Surprise Cave, New York
entrapment, key broke off in lock
David Borger, Stu Syms, and three other cavers entered
Surprise Cave for an easy caving trip. Two in the party were
first-time cavers. The cave is gated, and they locked the gate
behind them as they entered to prevent unauthorized access.
They spent several hours caving and had an uneventful trip,
until it was time to exit. When Syms turned the key to unlock
the gate, it snapped off in the lock.
They tried for over an hour to get the lock open, with no
luck. Borger decided to try and squeeze through a small
opening between the gate and the cave wall. After stripping
off his coveralls and equipment, he was able to get through,
sustaining some bruises and abrasions during the effort.
Borger called the local fire department, and firemen were able
to cut the lock off with a power saw. The others then exited
unharmed.
1. David Borger, Incident report, 1 March 2000.
2. Stu Syms, Incident report, 20 September 1998.
Comments: Borger reports that the lock was an old one
which had been repeatedly soaked by spring floods. He
suggests keeping gate locks well maintained and lubricated.
When entering through a gate, cavers should always assess
the state of the locking mechanism. A few experimental
openings and closings can reveal problems that are more
enjoyable from the outside looking in.


********** 11 August
Coons Cave, Indiana
stranded in pit, inadequate equipment
A thirty-one year-old man was stranded in the cave when
he was unable to climb his homemade rope ladder at the
entrance pit. Rescuers fitted him with a harness and hauled
him out. He was exhausted but uninjured.
Jim Johnson, incident report, undated.
Comments: The stranded man had no caving experience
and did not have proper equipment.


********** 5 September
Sharps Cave, West Virginia
caver fall
Kathleen Sharkey (49), entered the cave in a group of
eight cavers led by Frank Tirado and George Palmos. Palmos
and Tirado were cavers of many years experience, while
Sharkey and several others in the group were novices.
Sharkey was wearing a plastic, construction-type hardhat with
an elastic chinstrap. The helmet did not fit well, and kept
sliding down over her eyes whenever she bumped it on the
ceiling or looked down.
The group followed a passage leading down into a fissure,
but soon decided to backtrack and take another route. As
Sharkey climbed back out of the fissure, she looked down to
find the next foothold. Her helmet slid down as before, but the
brim struck the rock, pushing her head backwards. She lost
her grip and fell backwards into the fissure, landing on her
back on a ridge of rock. As she landed, the force of the impact
knocked the helmet from her head.
Tirado had gone ahead after pointing out the climb to
Sharkey. He heard the fall and her cry, and rushed back to
help. He found her lying at the bottom of the fissure. She felt
pain between her shoulder blades and her head hurt from the
impact. After a few minutes, she was able to sit up, though it
was very painful. She decided she could make it out with
some assistance. The others helped her up the climb and out of
the cave, taking care to minimize movement of her back.
An ambulance was summoned, and the medical
technicians fitted her with a spine splint to immobilize her
head and neck. She was taken to the hospital, and was initially
thought to have broken several ribs at the point where they
meet the vertebrae. Later examination determined that she
suffered only severe bruising.
Frank Tirado, Incident report, 2 October 1998.
Comments: Sharkey feels that her helmet choice was the
cause of her fall. After her experience she decided she would
"definitely invest in my own good helmet" before caving
again. As pointed out in previous issues of ACA, cheap
helmets with elastic chinstraps do not provide adequate
protection for caving. A climbing or caving helmet with an
inelastic chinstrap would have remained in place before and
during the fall. A good helmet is well worth the investment.
It's a lot cheaper than a trip to the emergency room.

---------- Page 51 ----------
1998 Accident and Incident Reports
Cavers should also be aware of the risk involved in
moving a person who has fallen and is complaining of back or
neck pain. The possibility of spinal injury must always be
considered. Moving a person with spinal fractures can damage
or even sever the spinal cord. Training is required to evaluate
an accident victim for such an injury. As in the Moaning Cave
incident reported previously, the wisest course may be to go
for help and return with trained personnel and a spinal
immobilization device.


********** 3 October
Cassell Cave, West Virginia
stranded, inadequate equipment
Jason Wicken (19), Buddy Hames (19), and Gabriel
Bernert (18) rappelled into the 96-foot pit entrance on
Saturday intending to exit via the lower Stream Entrance.
They found the way blocked by flood debris. They did not
have climbing equipment, and were stranded until Monday,
when rescuers found them after they were reported overdue.
George Dasher, "Rockin' Chair, The West Virginia Caver,
v17n1, p. 9.
Comments: Always carry your climbing rig with you when
vertical caving. You should have both ascending and
descending gear ready while on rope. You never know when
you may need to change from rappel to climb, or make other
maneuvers. And you certainly don't want to be stranded like
these guys. They thought the route was permanently blocked,
but cavers familiar with the cave expect to dig through such
debris as part of a routine trip there.


********** 3 October
J-4 Cave, Pennsylvania
caver fall
A group was exploring the cave on Saturday during the
MAR convention weekend. A caver fell about 20-30 feet
down a slope, injuring his leg and back. Other cavers present
were able to help him walk out on his own. He was met by an
ambulance at the entrance and taken to the hospital. He was
reportedly seen back at the convention on crutches that
evening.

********** 12 October
Bowden Cave, West Virginia
lost
At 7:00 p.m. Sunday evening three people from Salem,
West Virginia, entered Bowden Cave carrying only
flashlights. The following morning they were reported
overdue, and local cave rescue groups were called in by the
Volunteer Fire Department. When a quick search of the
entrance area failed to find anyone, a more detailed search of
the five-mile long cave was initiated. At the same time, due to
the size of the cave system, rescue groups that had been
placed on standby were called in. As these groups started to
arrive on scene, word came from the cave that the three
individuals had been located and were being escorted from the
cave under their own power.

********** 13 October
Neversink Pit, Alabama
tree fall in pit
Several cavers were taking turns rappelling and climbing
the large open-air 162-foot pit, when the cavers at the top
heard a rock break loose and fall from an area on the south
edge of the pit. They yelled "Rock!" to warn those below,
then watched in disbelief as a 75-foot tall, 18-inch diameter
tree broke loose from its base and fell into the pit. The tree
landed in the "safe" area where cavers normally stand on
bottom to watch other cavers on rope. Two cavers were on
rope when the tree fell, but no one was on the bottom. No one
was injured.
Evelyn Townsend, Incident report, 2 November 1998.
Comments: Caves are natural erosional features. This pit
has a 30-foot by 60-foot opening located in a slightly larger
diameter sink. Anything on the rim of or inside the sink is
going to wind up on bottom sooner or later. This is something
to be aware of in any pit. The tree was dead, and was already
hanging over the pit. Its roots had been undermined by the
growth of the sink. In years past, cavers used it as a rig point.

********** 24 October
Pinnacles Cave, Nevada
stranded, difficulty on ladder, inexperience
David Starling, Claire Jacobi, and Gene Frodsham, all
experienced cavers, planned a quick trip to Pinnacles Cave
(120-foot entrance pit, two drops). They arrived at the cave at
10:00 a.m. Gear was scattered near the mouth, including two
coils of cable ladder. Voices were heard below and they were
informed that there were eight people in the cave. Two ropes
were rigged in the pit: one to a pulley above the mouth and
dropping into the cave and another to a tree and a rock on the
south side of the pit.
Frodsham's group rigged two ropes for their own descent.
They caught up with the first group and waited while they
went through the Corkscrew, then talked with them in the
Lunch Room. There were seven people in the group. Three
had previously been in the cave but were not very experienced
cavers. The others had no previous caving experience.

---------- Page 52 ----------
1998 Accident and Incident Reports
Frodsham's group went on to the end of the cave and
returned. Starling gave one person from the other group a
headlamp and was asked to drop their ascending gear when he
reached the surface. This caused the experienced cavers some
concern. Frodsham's group finished exiting the cave at 4:10
p.m. and lowered the other group's ascending gear as
requested. The gear was a crude arrangement of webbing and
prusiks.
Frodsham and his companions waited an hour while the
leader of the other group exited, taking 30 minutes to climb
the first 70 feet. They helped by rigging the cable ladders
while the other group leader rigged the belay. One person
successfully came up the ladder. The second was stranded on
the ladder when the belay, rigged to a knob at a ledge along
the mouth, came loose. The Gibbs ascender being used
became jammed at the pulley over the mouth of the cave,
allowing the climber to drop about 40 feet during the slipping
and fouling of the belay.
The group leader, who was belaying, called down to have
the climber attach himself to the ladder. Frodsham pointed out
that if anything went wrong the climber would not be able to
go up or down. Soon after, the leader called down to the
climber that he was unable to free the belay rope because of
the climber's weight.
Frodsham took over, and rigged the end of the belay rope
through a rappel rack attached to a tree near the mouth of the
cave. Starling and Jacobi stayed to untangle and tend the
belay, while Frodsham rigged on rope and descended to the
climber. The climber had attached his harness directly to the
ladder with a locking carabiner, using no pigtail, and was
stranded about 15 to 20 feet above the floor. He had been in
that position for over 20 minutes.
An ascender was rigged from his harness to one of the
other ropes. The locking carabiner was jammed, defying
attempts to open it, and was finally opened with pliers sent up
from the party below. The climber was suspended from the
safety, with the ladder as backup, while the belay rope was
released and re-rigged. Starling and Jacobi then used the
rappel rack to lower the climber on the belay line.
One member of the group was sent up the ladder on belay.
Frodsham noticed that one of the cavers, an 11-year-old boy,
was shivering uncontrollably, SO the boy was prepared for the
next ascent. The belayers virtually pulled him from the cave.
The once-stranded climber said he did not have the strength
for the ladder. Frodsham fitted him with a ropewalker system
and he climbed out on his own.
The remaining people in the group were sent up the rope
using the ropewalker, finally exiting the cave just before 9:00
p.m. De-rigging was completed quickly and all were on the
paved road to Las Vegas by 9:30 p.m. One of the group
members had instructed his wife to call the police if he was
not home by 10:00 p.m. The quick intervention of the cavers
of the Southern Nevada Grotto averted an official rescue and
kept the relieved party from endangering themselves in
attempts to free the climber and the belay rope.
Gene Frodsham, Incident report, undated.
Comments: Frodsham's group did a good job of managing
a potentially serious incident. The full description is included
to illustrate an effective small-party rescue.
Frodsham writes: "After the trip was organized, the one
experienced person had declined to go and the others did not
cancel the trip. The leader knew how to rig and did the above-
ground rigging well, but not the belay; he was not properly
prepared to hold the position of leader.
"The cave is not a beginners cave and the four neophytes
had no business being there. None of the group even
recognized the first signs of hypothermia in the child. The
leader's ascending system was crude and the cable ladder
inappropriate for inexperienced adventurers. The cave
requires more than the thread-bare minimum of equipment the
group possessed."

Spring Hill Saltpeter Cave, Tennessee
fatality, caver fall, inadequate equipment
Jason Bishop (14) and two friends entered the cave mid-
day on Wednesday. They had only one flashlight between
them, and had no helmets or other caving equipment. They
were making the steep and slippery descent from the entrance
down to the main passage when Bishop lost his footing and
fell. He tumbled about 50-feet down the rocky slope,
sustaining multiple injuries. Help was summoned, and Bishop
was taken by helicopter to a hospital about an hour after the
accident. He died two days later from injures sustained in the
fall.
David Straight, Incident report, 12 November 1998.
Comments: Bishop and his companions clearly did not
have proper training or equipment for safe caving. This
accident resulted in a lawsuit against the cave owners by
Bishop's family. The suit is ongoing as of March, 2000.

Pyeatts Cave, Arizona
illness, exhaustion
Fifteen cavers were engaged in a cleanup trip in the cave,
removing spray paint and trash. After lunch most of the crew
left, but six cavers decided to stay and tour the 1,600-foot-
long cave. Two in the group were seventh-grade students,
about 12 years of age.
On the way out, two of the adults noticed that one of the
students was stumbling. She said she was tired and feeling
sick. As they helped her over to a place where she could lie
down and rest, they realized that she was completely
exhausted. They still had a lot of caving to do to reach the
entrance, including a 20-foot climb, a 30-foot traverse, and
several ledges to cross.
They considered sending out for help, but the student said
she would rather try to get out with their help. For the next
two hours, they crawled, walked, and carried the girl out of
the cave. They exited at about 7:30 p.m., and took the girl to
the nearest hospital. She was treated with IV fluids for severe
dehydration. In later discussion, they realized that no one had
seen her drinking very much during the trip.
Steve Willsey, Incident report, undated.
Comments: The cavers noted that they should have been
more alert to the condition of the young cavers, asking them

Gabinarraca Cave, Costa Rica
illness, histoplasmosis
Gabinarraca Cave (also known as Venado) is the only
show cave in Costa Rica. The cave is privately owned, and is
visited by more than 500 people each week. Guided tours are
offered daily, and visitors are provided with boots, lights, and
helmets. In 1998, the regular tour covered about 1,200 meters
of passage in the 2,741-meter long cave and lasted two and
one-half hours. The cave harbors an estimated population of
more than 4,000 bats.
Following an October 1998 visit to the cave by a school
group of 61 children and 14 adults, 35 members of the group
reported a flu-like illness. Symptoms developed several days
after the caving trip. Two members of the group were
hospitalized and were diagnosed with Acute Histoplasmosis.
Despite annual visits by the school, no illness had been
reported previously. Many in the group had visited the cave
before with no ill effects.
The week before the visit, Hurricane Mitch had passed
through the area with heavy rains which caused severe
flooding in the cave. Large amounts of debris washed through
the cave and out the entrance. The children who were most
affected had gone through some muddy crawls and "played in
the mud."
1. Carlos Goicoechea, Incident report, undated.
2. Marshall Lyon, Investigation summary, US Center for
Disease Control, 29 June 1999.
Comments: As a result of the outbreak, a study was done
by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The analysis showed
that the persons most affected were more likely to have
crawled in the cave, or to have visited the last room in the wet
part of the cave. They were also less likely to have been
exposed to chickens at home, or to have visited the dry part of
the cave. Affected persons were also less likely to have
washed their hands after exiting the cave or before eating.
Investigators suggested that certain activities, such as
crawling, and certain environmental factors, such as heavy
rains, may increase the risk of Acute Histoplasmosis when
visiting bat caves.
Following the study, the tour was limited to 17 participants
per group, and shortened to 700 meters and 1.5 hours
duration. All participants are now required to wear masks in
the cave and to shower after exiting.

Cumberland Caverns, Tennessee
fatality, heart attack in cave
Harris Renfroe (59) was with a church group on a guided
tour of the undeveloped section of the cave when he suffered a
heart attack. The group was moving through a section of
smaller passage about 1,000 feet from the developed section
of the cave at about 7:30 p.m. when Renfroe suddenly
collapsed. Some of the group members began CPR while the
guide and several others went for help.
Emerging into the developed section of the cave, they
encountered Kris Beckwith, an employee and caver, who
called 911 and notified other Cumberland Caverns staff.
When the first emergency medical technician arrived,
Beckwith took him and his equipment into the cave and to
Renfroe, arriving at about 8:30 p.m. Group members were still
performing CPR, but Renfroe had no pulse. They continued
CPR until the arrival of additional medical technicians, who
took over. Eventually, the efforts at resuscitation were halted.

Comments: Steward observes that to a trapper, a cave
entrance might seem like a pretty good place for a trap. Cave
entrances have both cave and surface hazards.

Peppersauce Cave, Arizona
caver fall
Charlie Bellanger (47), Rob Roberson (44), Clint

Boy Scout Troop 264 were on their first caving trip in
Peppersauce Cave. Peppersauce is probably the most-visited
wild cave in Arizona. Each had a helmet with chinstrap and at
least three sources of light. All were wearing tennis shoes. A
scout remembered this from the caving presentation to the
troop by NSS member Ray Keeler.
After three hours of exploring, some of it crawling over
the muddy slopes due to lack of traction, they were directed
over to the Pool Room by another group. A ladder constructed

Paradise Springs, Florida
fatality, silted out, no guideline
Two open-water divers entered Paradise Springs in Marion
County. They entered the cave portion of the spring without a
guide line and descended to a depth of 148 feet. They
apparently silted out the system and got separated. One diver
attempted to exit, but became wedged in a crack and was
unable to get free.
His diving partner saw him disappear in the silt cloud and
thought the cave had collapsed on him. She ascended to the
surface to obtain help. Rescue divers responded, arriving an
hour later. They entered the cave and located the diver, but
were unable to retrieve the body. The NSS Cave Diving
Section Recovery Team was called.
The Recovery Team responded and found that the cave
had not collapsed. The diver had wedged himself into a small
crevice. He apparently thought he could not get free. He
released his harness, backed out, and started a free ascent

of 2x4's with rungs of 1x3's had been placed at the nine-foot
overhung nuisance drop. All five descended the ladder and
looked around the room, then started up the ladder to return to
the Big Room.
Bellanger was last up. While climbing out near the top, his
foot slipped off a step. He tried to stop his fall with his left
hand on a higher step. He turned as he fell, and managed to
avoid falling to the bottom. As he fell, however, Bellanger
broke his left humerus (upper arm bone) into six pieces.
Three men from another group in the cave came over to
help. A rope from the nearby Rabbit Hole was brought over
and a loop was tied under Bellanger's armpits. He was then
hoisted up the drop backwards (so he could help with his feet
on the ladder) and helped back to the Big Room.
Bellanger, an ER Physician's Assistant, thought that the
shoulder could be dislocated, SO Roberson tried to reduce the
arm in the Big Room. After realizing that the arm was
fractured and not dislocated, they used a sweat shirt as a sling.
Bellanger then started out, assisted by his companions. The
group took 45 minutes to get to the Big Room. They reached
the entrance in two hours.

Comments: Keeler writes: "My stressing three lights and

about the 44-foot level.
Henry Nicholson, Incident report, 23 September 1996.
Comments: The news media reported the cause of the
accident as collapse. A later report corrected the error.
There have been many similar incidents involving divers
who have open-water certification but no training or
certification in cave or cavern diving. Cave diving requires
special equipment and training beyond that which is required
for open water certification. Use of guidelines to provide
direction in zero-visibility conditions is just one of those
specialized techniques.

********** 17 August
Four Sharks Blue Hole, Bahamas
fatality, narcosis
Rob Parker (35) and Dan Malone entered Four Sharks
Blue Hole on an exploration and survey dive. The cave is
incompletely explored, and extends to depths greater than 300
feet. Their dive plan allowed for a penetration of up to 1,200
feet with bottom time of 40 minutes at a maximum depth of
250 feet. In addition to standard cave diving equipment, they
carried multiple cylinders of different gas mixtures to be used
at various depths and staged for decompression.
They entered the cave at 8:00 p.m., breathing compressed
air and leaving mixed gas (EANX 80) and oxygen cylinders
near the cave entrance at a depth of 30 feet for decompression.
They descended through the large main cavern to a fissure at
the back of the cavern about 300 feet from the entrance and at
a depth of 120 feet. There they left two more mixed gas
cylinders (EANX 36) for decompression during their exit.
The fissure is a vertical fracture about two feet wide at its
entrance and varying in width from two to 20 feet. Its depth is
unknown. A permanent guide line was in place and was used
throughout the dive. They proceeded into the fissure and
through a 30-foot long restriction, following the guide line
about 175 feet along the fissure to another restriction followed
by larger passage at a depth of 150 to 170 feet. After breathing
one-third of their air stage, they switched to Trimix cylinders
(15% oxygen, 40% helium, 45% nitrogen) eight minutes into
the dive and at a depth of 220 feet, as planned.
At 12 minutes they reached the end of the fixed line.
Malone tied on a new reel and they proceeded. The passage at
this point was 15 to 20 feet wide with no floor in sight. At 20
minutes, they tied off the line and began their exit, surveying
back to the end of the original line. During the survey, the
regulator on one of Malone's Trimix cylinders failed, but he
was able to continue using his other cylinder and did not
inform Parker.
The divers began their ascent following the fixed line,
intending to change back to compressed air at 220 feet depth.
Malone ran out of Trimix early and switched to air at 250 feet.
Parker switched at 220 feet as planned. There, they
communicated for the last time, both indicating that they were
OK.
Swimming in single file with Parker in front, they passed
under a boulder and ascended to a depth of about 180 feet. At
that point, Malone noticed Parker beginning to sink, still
breathing. He swam after Parker, catching him by the ankle
and stopping the descent at a depth of about 230 feet. Malone
then grabbed Parker by his buoyancy compensator and began
swimming back to the line. Kicking strenuously and using his
power inflator, Malone towed Parker back up to the line. In
the process he lost both of his fins.
San Diego Union-Tribune, 30 December 1996, p. A-3.
Comments: The newspaper article notes that Yan was the
third diver to die at the spot in December.
Back at the guide line, Parker regained consciousness and
began to swim on his own. The line led into a restriction
which could be passed above or below the line. Parker entered
the restriction swimming about a foot above the line. Malone
entered just below it and proceeded. By then, Malone was
down to 300 psi in his air cylinder. When last seen, Parker
was swimming and appeared to be negotiating the restriction.
Malone proceeded through the restriction and pulled
himself on through the narrow passage and back to his
decompression tank at a depth of 120 feet at the main cavern.
He took two breaths from the tank, then turned back to the
fissure, shining his light into it and looking for Parker. Malone
waited for five minutes, but Parker did not emerge from the
fissure.
Malone then swam out into the cavern where support
divers Tom Iliffe and Gene Flipse were waiting. He spent
three hours and 20 minutes in decompression.
Parker's body was recovered on August 19 by Brian
Kakuk, Dan Malone, Stephanie Schwabe, and Tom Iliffe. He
was found head down and facing back into the cave in a 24 to
30-inch wide vertical restriction at a depth of 149 feet. Due to
the tight passage, Kakuk and Malone were unable to read the
pressure gauge on his air tank. Parker's equipment was
removed to help move him through the passage, and was to be
retrieved later. Kakuk and Malone moved the body through
the restriction about 175 feet to the main cavern and passed it
to Schwabe and Iliffe. Kakuk and Malone went back for
Parker's equipment, which could not be found. It had
apparently dropped into the deep fissure and could not be
recovered.

3. Brian Kakuk, Recovery report, 23 August 1997.
Comments: No autopsy was performed, but the divers
involved believe that Parker was suffering from nitrogen
narcosis, and that he became disoriented and wedged in the
fissure. Kakuk notes that while Parker was a very
accomplished and experienced cave diver specializing in deep
blue holes, with more than 1,000 dives logged, he had done
relatively little diving over the previous ten years. He had
logged several dives in the two weeks preceding the accident,
but no recent dives to the depths attained on August 17.

Fussell were practicing for an upcoming trip to Mexico. Gene
Fussell had not done any cave diving in the past year. None of
the divers had been to the cave before, SO they planned to do
an "easy tourist dive" to 130 feet and exit.
About ten minutes into the dive, Gene Fussell signaled that
he wished to return to the surface. Most of the exit was
normal, until they reached the beginning of the permanent
dive line. At that point, Fussell drifted to the ceiling, pointed
to his chest, refused buddy breathing, and required assistance
exiting. He reached the surface first, where he dropped his
regulator and called for help.
The other divers surfaced within seconds, and found him
unconscious. They began CPR while towing him to shore.
Paramedics were summoned and arrived about ten minutes
after the divers surfaced. Fussell was transported to a hospital.

The National Cave Rescue Commission
The National Cave Rescue Commission (NCRC) is a volunteer group developed to train cave rescue personnel throughout the
United States. It is part of the NSS, and is a unit Education Division within the Department of the Administrative Vice-President. The
NCRC does not perform cave rescues. It organizes, develops, and provides training in cave rescue techniques; maintains lists of cave
rescue trained persons; and can help locate rescue resources in times of need. Most NCRC-trained cavers do participate in rescues, but
not as part of the NCRC. They work as members of their local rescue squads, civil defense units, or cave rescue groups. The NCRC
also works to:
Maintain good working relationships with other rescue-oriented individuals, organizations, government agencies, and
sources of specialized equipment and services (e.g., the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center and Center for Mine Safety
and Health Administration).
Maintain current files of possibly useful equipment (including, but not limited to, underground communications
equipment, cave oriented medical kits, etc.) or services which can be obtained through the above sources.
Develop and maintain a limited supply of certain equipment such as special rescue litters and vertical rescue gear in key
locations throughout the country.
Increase the number and proficiency of cave rescuers across the U.S., by sponsoring training sessions and seminars, and
by encouraging other caving, rescue, or EMS organizations to sponsor such educational programs.
Encourage international cooperation by developing contacts with cave rescuers and rescue agencies in other countries, by
preplanning with these groups where U.S. involvement is anticipated, and by inviting participation of cave rescuers from
other countries in NCRC seminars.
Organization
The NCRC is led by a Board of Regional Coordinators. The Board includes a National Coordinator, Training Officer, Medical
Officer, and Diving Officer (each of whom coordinates resources and activities at a national level), and Regional Coordinators for
each of ten regions in the United States and its territories. Board members are nominated by cavers and cave rescue personnel, and
must be approved by the NSS Board of Governors. The NCRC depends on many volunteers with no official position whose special
knowledge, talents, or contacts make the network more effective.
Training
The NCRC sponsors a weeklong Cave Rescue Operations and Management Seminar each year which is held in various locations
around the U.S. The seminar serves as a "boot camp" of cave rescue and involves three levels of training. Cave rescue is constantly
evolving, and the most up-to-date techniques are presented each year. In addition to the annual national weeklong seminar, the NCRC
regions sponsors regional weeklong seminars, regional modular seminars (taught over a series of weekends), courses in small-group
and self-rescue techniques, and weekend cave rescue orientation courses.
NCRC seminars consist of extensive classroom and field work designed to maximize the learning experience. The cave rescue
programs provide studies in underground environments, vertical rescue, pulley systems, extrication techniques, basic medical
principles, communications, and management of cave rescue operations. Emphasis is placed on practical skills and techniques, with
realistic exercises in a variety of cave environments. The seminar provides basic and advanced material for students who typically
include cavers, emergency services personnel, and emergency managers. During the eight days of the seminar, students receive about
100 hours of instruction, and are "on the move" from early morning well into the evening. The NCRC uses and teaches the Incident
Command System (ICS) used by fire departments, rescue squads, and other emergency agencies and services.

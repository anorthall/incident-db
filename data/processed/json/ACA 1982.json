    "incident_report": "At about 2 p.m. on Saturday, January 30, 1982 a group of three cavers entered Sumidero Santa Elena, adjacent to the town of Xochitlan in Puebla, Mexico. They were Warren Anderson (late 20's), Bill Liebman (early 30's) and Dave Walker (early 30's), part of a group of nine cavers exploring this cave which was expected to connect to a resurgence cave three kilometers away. The sumidero had been explored a little over two km from the entrance, past 24 short roped drops (waterfalls) and 22 swims. When the exploration had begun, on January 12, stream flow monitoring at the entrance showed six cfs entering. Past drop 8 there are two tributaries which approximately double the main flow. On the 30th, with dry weather since the 12th, the entrance flow had dropped to two cfs.\n\nThe group proceeded past drop 24, to drop 25 and on to drop 26 where they turned back. Moving steadily, they passed through the series of spouting waterfalls (16-19) above drop 20 where one must negotiate an aid climb on the way down cave to reach the first ledge past drop 15. If you continue down-cave without doing the aid climb you quickly reach a cul-de-sac-a sure death-trap in a flood. With Anderson in the lead, they continued up cave, doubtless relieved at having passed through the section without ledges. At drop 14 Anderson ascended and began recarbiding, waiting for the others. Suddenly, at about 1 a.m., there was a surge of water noise. Thinking his ears were playing tricks, Anderson focussed his electric on the nearby falls, in time to see a surge of foul, brown water. Walker and Liebman, approaching drop 14 through chest deep water were caught. Walker pushed off, thrashed his way to the rope and quickly made it up. Liebman held on to the wall while Walker and Anderson jumped over to a ledge above him and lowered a long Jumar sling. Liebman was pulled up.\n\nThe ledge they were on was spacious so they settled in to see what would happen. The flow increased until the very walls were vibrating.\n\nAt about midnight there had occurred a torrential rain, which lasted for about 45 minutes, dumping 4 cm. The flow at the entrance had quickly swelled to some 20 cfs, then began to subside. The 20 cfs probably meant 40-50 cfs past drop eight where tributaries normally doubled the entrance flow. Those on the surface were alarmed but could do nothing. By dawn Sunday the flow was down to 7 cfs. At 8 p.m. Sunday no one had appeared so a group of three gathered medical and rigging supplies and headed in. The group was found at around 10 p.m., still on their ledge. Everyone was out by a.m.",
    "incident_analysis": "In the Xochitlan area, the weather is very changeable. The day of the entrapment there was no visibly threatening weather. Since then a program of keeping temperature/pressure records had yielded a pattern which probably would have predicted the storm causing the entrapment. Also, it was expected that there would be some warning signs in the cave before a flood hit. There were none. The cavers are lucky they were not caught below drop 16.",

    "original_text": "Sumidero Santa Elena, Puebla, Mexico\nJanuary 30, 1982\n\nAt about 2 p.m. on Saturday, January 30, 1982 a group of three cavers entered\nSumidero Santa Elena, adjacent to the town of Xochitlan in Puebla, Mexico. They\nwere Warren Anderson (late 20's), Bill Liebman (early 30's) and Dave Walker\n(early 30's), part of a group of nine cavers exploring this cave which was expected\nto connect to a resurgence cave three kilometers away. The sumidero had been\nexplored a little over two km from the entrance, past 24 short roped drops\n(waterfalls) and 22 swims. When the exploration had begun, on January 12, stream\nflow monitoring at the entrance showed six cfs entering. Past drop 8 there are two\ntributaries which approximately double the main flow. On the 30th, with dry\nweather since the 12th, the entrance flow had dropped to two cfs.\nTHe group proceeded past drop 24, to drop 25 and on to drop 26 where they\nturned back. Moving steadily, they passed through the series of spouting waterfalls\n(16-19) above drop 20 where one must negotiate an aid climb on the way down cave\nto reach the first ledge past drop 15. If you continue down-cave without doing the\naid climb you quickly reach a cul-de-sac-a sure death-trap in a flood. With\nAnderson in the lead, they continued up cave, doubtless relieved at having passed\nthrough the section without ledges. At drop 14 Anderson ascended and began\nrecarbiding, waiting for the others. Suddenly, at about 1 a.m., there was a surge of\nwater noise. Thinking his ears were playing tricks, Anderson focussed his electric\non the nearby falls, in time to see a surge of foul, brown water. Walker and\nLiebman, approaching drop 14 through chest deep water were caught. Walker\npushed off, thrashed his way to the rope and quickly made it up. Liebman held on to\nthe wall while Walker and Anderson jumped over to a ledge above him and lowered\na long Jumar sling. Liebman was pulled up.\nThe ledge they were on was spacious so they settled in to see what would happen.\nThe flow increased until the very walls were vibrating.\nAt about midnight there had occurred a torrential rain, which lasted for about 45\nminutes, dumping 4 cm. The flow at the entrance had quickly swelled to some 20\ncfs, then began to subside. The 20 cfs probably meant 40-50 cfs past drop eight\nwhere tributaries normally doubled the entrance flow. Those on the surface were\nalarmed but could do nothing. By dawn Sunday the flow was down to 7 cfs. At 8\np.m. Sunday no one had appeared so a group of three gathered medical and rigging\nsupples and headed in. The group was found at around 10 p.m., still on their ledge.\nEveryone was out by a.m.\nREFERENCE: Steve Knutson \"Sumidero Santa Elena\" NSS News 40:9 September,\n1982 pp 236-245.\nANALYSIS: In the Xochitlan area, the weather is very changeable. The day of the\nentrapment there was no visibly threatening weather. Since then a program of\nkeeping temperature/pressure records had yielded a pattern which probably would\nhave predicted the storm causing the entrapment. Also, it was expected that there\nwould be some warning signs in the cave before a flood hit. There were none. The\ncavers are lucky they were not caught below drop 16."

They debated whether or not to leave the Historic Route drops rigged in case the Splash Entrance should sump. They decided to leave only the entrance ladder rigged. When one of them checked the Fieldhouse they found Joe Saunders and Tom Patterson who had just exited a sumping Splash Entrance. The Historic drops were soon rerigged. Meanwhile Bill Allendorf, who had also gotten out Splash, had stayed at that entrance to warn those remaining not to try the virtual, but not quite, sump.\n\nJoe Saunders' group had split up into groups of two and three and, the group of three was mapping when they noticed the air flow stop.

    "incident_report": "On Saturday, March 27, a group of boy scouts of Troop 116 of Millstone Township visited Crooked Swamp Cave in Sussex County, New Jersey. Their caving leader was Jim Ewin, a caver of 30 years experience, but Ewin was suffering from a bad cold and did not enter the cave. The bus driver and overall scout leader was Don Weltner (48) a New Jersey State Trooper. Weltner's caving experience was very limited-the only cave he was known to have visited before this trip was Shofer's Cave near Kurtztown, Pennsylvania. He was reported to be in excellent physical condition and was of average size-5 foot 11 inches, 160 pounds.\n\nThe group first looked at maps of the cave, discussing parts of the system, including \"difficult areas or places to avoid.\" All but Ewin spent the morning in small groups, exploring the constricted passages. Two other adults accompanied the group but they had no caving experience. The 16 scouts ranged in age from 11 to 16 and about half had previous experience in Shofer's Cave.\n\nWeltner was wearing a long-sleeved shirt and pants with rubber-soled boots. His helmet had a chin strap but no mounted light. His main light source was a hand-held flashlight.\n\nThe Crooked Swamp Cave has seven entrances but one is not enterable. It is basically \"a horizontal network of passages a few feet below the six base entrances and fifteen feet below the sinkhole entrance.\" There is 1250 feet of surveyed passage, principally low crawlway with some very high but narrow vertical fissures. The traverse between some entrances is very difficult or impossible. Passage walls are very irregular with jagged projections. The cave is normally 55-57 degrees but its shallow nature and air movement coupled with cool weather and cold nights rendered it cooler at the time of the accident.\n\nLunch was eaten outside and at that time it was proposed to have a \"manhunt\" in the cave during the afternoon, with ice cream as the prize. Accordingly, three scouts went in first, in an entrance of their choice to get \"lost\" and evade the others. After ten minutes the others began the pursuit. Weltner with his two sons and another scout went in an entrance just south of Tree Root Cave, a part of the cave system that was connected on the map by dotted lines. Weltner was aware of this but tried to force the connection anyway. At perhaps 3 p.m. (the time is uncertain since Weltner first would not admit he was stuck) Weltner entered a narrow, body-sized crevice, with a small ledge making it wider at the top. He apparently slipped off this ledge and became wedged in the bottom of the keyhole. At that point the passage is only a couple feet high and 7-8 inches wide below the ledge. Weltner's head was downslope from his feet. For the coming rescue attempt, it was difficult to reach his feet and impossible to reach his head, except for a very small person, from the Tree Root Cave side.\n\nShortly after 3 p.m. all but Weltner's group had grown cold and left the cave. An adult, waiting on the surface entered at 3:20 and learned that the victim was stuck. A rope was obtained and one end looped around Weltner's feet. Pulling had no effect. At 4:50 one scout braced the victim's feet and he was able to move forward 9 to 12 inches, until his pants crotch snagged. The victim was already slipping into hypothermia as his speech had become slurred.\n\nIt was thought to lever him up to free him but no suitable board could be found. From 4:45 to 5:30, outside rescuers were contacted, including the Blue Ridge Rescue Squad and NCRC. The Rescue Squad notified the New Jersey State Police who were naturally very concerned and came in force.\n\nAt 7:30 p.m. Weltner had become somewhat incoherent and it was recommended that heat was needed. From that point, numerous attempts to warm the victim were made but none were successful. These included hot water bottles, gel packs (chemical heat), a sheet soaked in hot water, a portable electric heater, and a portable hot-air generator for telephone work in manholes.\n\nBy 1 a.m. Sunday, it became clear \"that all attempts to stabilize Weltner's condition by application of heat had not arrested his slide into hypothermia.\" Yet another attempt at pulling him back yielded no result and at 3 a.m. there was no sign of life from the victim. At 6 a.m. a rescuer was able to get close enough to detect residual body heat at mid-thigh.\n\nAt 6 a.m. it was decided that ordinary extraction would not work and the go-ahead was given to use \"extraordinary\" means. This led to a 20 foot shaft being drilled to intercept the cave two feet from Weltner. Twelve hours later, it was found that the shaft intercepting the cave has missed the correct spot by 10-12 feet. From about 6:30 p.m. Sunday to midnight on Monday/Tuesday cavers worked to enlarge the passage from the shaft to Weltner. A jackhammer, hydraulic rock splitter, and explosives were used. Finally, early Monday evening, a harness was fitted around Weltner's chest and he was moved two feet toward the shaft. He could not be moved further, however, and at midnight it was decided to remove the victim by quarrying.\n\nQuarrying commenced at 2 a.m. The work involved blasting, backhoe work and drilling and Weltner received a number of post-mortem injuries in the process. His body was recovered at 11:40 p.m. Tuesday.",
    "incident_analysis": "When Weltner's body was finally removed, it was reported that a \"piece of rock behind Weltner's right hip had acted as a keystone, thwarting efforts to move him.\" Even when quarrying removed the cave from 3/4 of his body a come-along was required to completely free him. It is obvious in hind-sight that all the attempts to pull him back from his entrapment were futile. At the same time, though some efforts were made to warm the victim, none were successful, and it seems from the reports that getting the victim free was foremost in people's minds. And why shouldn't it be? Yet it must be recognized that there are some rescue situations which are better served by maintaining the victim, then effecting his evacuation or extraction when the means are obtained or discovered. Thus, if at first Weltner's rescuers had decided that keeping him warm was to be the primary objective, and the means had been thus obtained-perhaps a very effecient forced hot air blower-Weltner might still be alive. This, of course, is hindsight and not meant to belittle the efforts of rescuers, merely to suggest procedures for the future.\n\nThe responsibility for this accident rests squarely on Weltner himself. He is characterized as venturesome and \"daring.\" \"In a cave he couldn't get his fill and tackled small passages or difficult spots without apparent fear or hesitation.\" Besides this, Jim Ewin suggests the following to have contributed to the situation: 1) The challange of the game of hide and seek they had devised, 2) a desire to redeem himself for having failed to get through a small passage that morning, 3) the impassable nature of the crawl, which he may have forgotten or been misled about by voices ahead, and 4) the great danger of tight passages, of which he was unaware.\n\nTo these I certainly agree. Indeed, the whole thrust of their outing was wrong, teaching the young scouts and potentially future cavers to be daring-that caves are places to play games in-instead of teaching them caution and good judgement. As with climbing, in caving one must learn one's limits. Forcing a tight passage may be heroic and noteworthy, but it can also be fatal. What goes in doesn't necessarily come back out.",

    "original_text": "Crooked Swamp Cave, New Jersey\nMarch 27, 1982\n\nOn Saturday, March 27, a group of boy scouts of Troop 116 of Millstone Township\nvisited Crooked Swamp Cave in Sussex County, New Jersey. Their caving leader\nwas Jim Ewin, a caver of 30 years experience, but Ewin was suffering from a bad\ncold and did not enter the cave. The bus driver and overall scout leader was Don\nWeltner (48) a New Jersey State Trooper. Weltner's caving experience was very\nlimited-the only cave he was known to have visited before this trip was Shofer's\nCave near Kurtztown, Pennsylvania. He was reported to be in excellent physical\ncondition and was of average size-5 foot 11 inches, 160 pounds.\nThe group first looked at maps of the cave, discussing parts of the system,\nincluding \"difficult areas or places to avoid.' All but Ewin spent the morning in\nsmall groups, exploring the constricted passages. Two other adults accompanied\nthe group but they had no caving experience. The 16 scouts ranged in age from 11\nto 16 and about half had previous experience in Shofer's Cave.\nWeltner was wearing a long-sleeved shirt and pants with rubber-soled boots. His\nhelmet had a chin strap but no mounted light. His main light source was a\nhand-held flashlight.\nThe Crooked Swamp Cave has seven entrances but one is not enterable. It is\nbasically \"a horizontal network of passages a few feet below the six base entrances\nand fifteen feet below the sinkhole entrance.\" There is 1250 feet of surveyed\npassage, principally low crawlway with some very high but narrow vertical fissures.\nThe traverse between some entrances is very difficult or impossible. Passage walls\nare very irregular with jagged projections. The cave is normally 55-57 degrees but\nits shallow nature and air movement coupled with cool weather and cold nights\nrendered it cooler at the time of the accident.\nLunch was eaten outside and at that time it was proposed to have a \"manhunt\"\nin the cave during the afternoon, with ice cream as the prize. Accordingly, three\nscouts went in first, in an entrance of their choice to get \"lost\" and evade the\nothers. After ten minutes the others began the pursuit. Weltner with his two sons\nand another scout went in an entrance just south of Tree Root Cave, a part of the\ncave system that was connected on the map by dotted lines. Weltner was aware of\nthis but tried to force the connection anyway. At perhaps 3 p.m. (the time is\nuncertain since Weltner first would not admit he was stuck) Weltner entered a\nnarrow, body-sized crevice, with a small ledge making it wider at the top. He\napparently slipped off this ledge and became wedged in the bottom of the keyhole.\nAt that point the passage is only a couple feet high and 7-8 inches wide below the\nledge. Weltner's head was downslope from his feet. For the coming rescue\nattempt, it was difficult to reach his feet and impossible to reach his head, except\nfor a very small person, from the Tree Root Cave side.\nShortly after 3 p.m. all but Weltner's group had grown cold and left the cave. An\nadult, waiting on the surface entered at 3:20 and learned that the victim was stuck.\nA rope was obtained and one end looped around Weltner's feet. Pulling had no\neffect. At 4:50 one scout braced the victim's feet and he was able to move forward 9\nto 12 inches, until his pants crotch snagged. The victim was already slipping into\nhypothermia as his speech had become slurred.\nIt was thought to lever him up to free him but no suitable board could be found.\nFrom 4:45 to 5:30, outside rescuers were contacted, including the Blue Ridge\nRescue Squad and NCRC. The Rescue Squad notified the New Jersey State Police\nwho were naturally very concerned and came in force.\nt 7:30 p.m. Weltner had become somewhat incoherent and it was recommended\nthat heat was needed. From that point, numerous attempts to warm the victim were\nmade but none were successful. These included hot water bottles, gel packs\n(chemical heat), a sheet soaked in hot water, a portable electric heater, and a\nportable hot-air generator for telephone work in manholes.\nBy 1 a.m. Sunday, it became clear \"that all attempts to stabilize Weltner's\ncondition by application of heat had not arrested his slide into hypothermia.' Yet\nanother attempt at pulling him back yielded no result and at 3 a.m. there was no\nsign of life from the victim. At 6 a.m. a rescuer was able to get close enough to\ndetect residual body heat at mid-thigh.\nAt 6 a.m. it was decided that ordinary extraction would not work and the\ngo-ahead was given to use \"extraordinary\" means. This led to a 20 foot shaft being\ndrilled to intercept the cave two feet from Weltner. Twelve hours later, it was found\nthat the shaft intercepting the cave has missed the correct spot by 10-12 feet. From\nabout 6:30 p.m. Sunday to midnight on Monday/Tuesday cavers worked to enlarge\nthe passage from the shaft to Weltner. A jackhammer, hydraulic rock splitter, and\nexplosives were used. Finally, early Monday evening, a harness was fitted around\nWeltner's chest and he was moved two feet toward the shaft. He could not be\nmoved further, however, and at midnight it was decided to remove the victim by\nquarrying.\nQuarrying commenced at 2 a.m. The work involved blasting, backhoe work and\ndrilling and Weltner received a number of post-mortem injuries in the process. His\nbody was recovered at 11:40 p.m. Tuesday.\nREFERENCES: (Newspaper references are representative, not complete) 1) AP\n\"Scout Leader Trapped in Cave, Feared Dead\" Philadelphia Enquirer Monday,\nMarch 29, 1982 pp 1-A, 8-A.\n2) AP \"Efforts to Save Spelunker Fail\" The Patriot (Harrisburg, PA) Monday,\nMarch 29, 1982 pp 1,2.\n3) Anon. \"Hopes Dim for Trooper In Cave\" Tulsa World Monday, March 29, 1982 p\nA 14.\n4) Editor \"Rescue Crews Try New Tactics in Cave\" The Atlanta Journal March 30,\n1982.\n5) Jim Norman and Sam Rosensohn\" Breakthrough, but Hopes Fade for Cop in\nCave\" New York Post Tuesday, March 30, 1982 3.\n6)AP \"Blasting Tried to Free Trooper\" The Oregonian (Portland, OR) Wednesday,\nMarch 31, 1982 p A11.\n7) AP \"Body of N.J.

Dalton et al. \"Crooked Swamp Caves # 2-3-7\" Caves of New Jersey\nBulletin 70 New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Geology and\nTopography June, 1976 pp 20-23.\nANALYSIS: When Weltner's body was finally removed, it was reported that a\n\"piece of rock behind Weltner's right hip had acted as a keystone, thwarting efforts\nto move him.' Even when quarrying removed the cave from 3/4 of his body a\ncome-along was required to completely free him. It is obvious in hind-sight that all\nthe attempts to pull him back from his entrapment were futile. At the same time,\nthough some efforts were made to warm the victim, none were successful, and it\nseems from the reports that getting the victim free was foremost in people's minds.\nAnd why shouldn't it be? Yet it must be recognized that there are some rescue\nsituations which are better served by maintaining the victim, then effecting his\nevacuation or extraction when the means are obtained or discovered. Thus, if at\nfirst Weltner's rescuers had decided that keeping him warm was to be the primary\nobjective, and the means had been thus obtained-perhaps a very effecient forced\nhot air blower-Weltner might still be alive. This, of course, is hindsight and not\nmeant to belittle the efforts of rescuers, merely to suggest procedures for the\nfuture.\nThe responsibility for this accident rests squarely on Weltner himself. He is\ncharacterized as venturesome and \"daring.' \"In a cave he couldn't get his fill and\ntackled small passages or difficult spots without apparent fear or hesitation.\"\nBesides this, Jim Ewin suggests the following to have contributed to the situation:\n1) The challange of the game of hide and seek they had devised, 2) a desire to\nredeem himself for having failed to get through a small passage that morning, 3)\nthe impassable nature of the crawl, which he may have forgotten or been misled\nabout by voices ahead, and 4) the great danger of tight passages, of which he was\nunaware.\nTo these I certainly agree. Indeed, the whole thrust of their outing was wrong,\nteaching the young scouts and potentially future cavers to be daring-that caves\nare places to play games in-instead of teaching them caution and good judgement.\nAs with climbing, in caving one must learn one's limits. Forcing a tight passage\nmay be heroic and noteworthy, but it can also be fatal. What goes in doesn't\nnecessarily come back out."

    "incident_report": "In April of 1982 a group of 17 cavers was on the Huautla Plateau working on Sistema Huautla, a group of vertically-oriented, very deep caves, which are hydrologically, and in some cases physically, connected.\n\nOn Friday, April 16, six members of the expedition left to return to the United States. At five entered Nita Nashi for a one day push from the surface. Four, Ed Holladay, Mark Minton, Doug Powell (late 20's) and Lisa Wilk were to break camp at -600 meters in Nita Nanta and return to the surface that day. This left two on the surface.\n\nAt about 11:30 a.m. Minton and Wilk started out followed by Powell and Holladay. Past the 'blasted area', a tight place where they had to unpack and pass gear through, Powell took the lead.\n\nAt the 22nd drop, leading to the Narrows, he chose to free climb, with a single Jumar on the rope, sliding it along as he climbed, for a safety. At 5 p.m., partway up, Powell had a handhold for his left hand above his head when his foothold(s) broke. The safety sling was not quite tight and his weight plus that of his camp duffel (at least 30 lbs) came suddenly on his left arm, dislocating his left shoulder.\n\nThere was no immediate pain so he lowered himself to a ledge and called for Holladay. Holladay arrived and made two unsuccessful attempts to reset the shoulder. When Wilk and Minton arrived they moved back down two narrow drops to a somewhat wider place, some 6Wx12Lx10H, and set up a bivouac at about -330m on the stream-gravel floor. Further attempts to reset the shoulder were unsuccessful. Sleeping bags were set up on a space blanket and ensolite pads, with the cave stream flowing through the gravel under the space blanket. Wilk was left with Powell while Minton and Holladay headed for the surface.\n\nTwo hours later, on the surface, they found only Mike Doe, Ted Wilson and Alejandro Villagomez, an experienced caver from Mexico City. Several days worth of food, a stove and stove fuel were packed up and transported to the bivouac by Doe and Villagomez, arriving early Saturday morning.\n\nPowell's shoulder had begun to hurt badly and he was unable to sleep. Some relief was gained through occasional massaging of the shoulder by Wilk. When the first surface relief arrived, Codeine was administered but did not entirely relieve the pain. Doe had a book that showed how to reset a dislocation but two or three attempts were unsuccessful. Then Doe stayed with the victim while Villagomez and Wilk headed out.\n\nThe crew from Nita Nashi had exited and were briefed on the situation by the others. Since Powell's condition was stable, they got some rest to be ready if manpower was needed for an evacuation. Minton and others took the expedition bus to Huautla to get additional pain killers and a doctor's instructions on how to reset the shoulder.\n\nSaturday afternoon Holladay and Wilson took additional drugs and food and stove fuel to the bivouac. Powell's morale was by now a little low. His left knee, which he noticed as feeling sore the day before, was now red and swollen, extremely painful to the slightest touch. Vallium was injected for the shoulder and two hours later they attempted to reset it with no success. Holliday and Doe then exited the cave leaving Wilson with Powell. Vallium was injected every 12 hours and this allowed some sleep.\n\nMeanwhile plans were made in case Powell could not make it out under his own power-calls were made to the United States to establish a rescue liaison and a call was made to Mexico City which would produce a doctor the following morning.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon Hans Bodenheimer, Mike McWhirter and Scott Davis proceeded in to the bivouac. Bodenheimer had been present at a previous occasion when Powell had dislocated the same shoulder and had it reset. When they arrived, muscle relaxants and antibiotics were administered. After two hours, with Bodenheimer and McWhirter in the proper positions and exerting all their strength, two attempts were made before the shoulder reset with a loud 'pop.' Only a dull ache remained. After a meal, however, chills set in and it became obvious that the infected knee was a serious problem, though the victim was now able to sleep.\n\nOn Monday the doctor, Artur Pareja Reyes, accompanied by Villagomez and Wilk, headed in to treat the infected leg. Four other Mexican cavers, two from the police and two from ISSSTE (Fire Department) had also arrived but were kept with the surface crew. Pain killers were administered, the arm and leg immobilized with heavy bandaging, and the victim started out under his own power with some assistance from his companions.\n\nAfter four hours and six drops the heavily medicated Powell needed to sleep, so another bivouac was set up and eight hours of sleep obtained, at least by Powell. Fortunately the drops above the accident bivouac were well suited to the Texas method that Powell was forced to use, having only one usable arm and leg. He reached the surface at about 6 p.m. on Tuesday, April 20. The normal three hour trip had taken 14 hours.",
    "incident_analysis": "This sort of accident could happen to anyone but Powell might be more prone to shoulder dislocations since he had suffered one previously. If one has a disability that can recur 'spontaneously' one might be careful to avoid situations that could lead to its recurrence. In this case, using his ascending rig instead of free-climbing should have prevented the accident. Carrying a load could lead to a shoulder dislocation in anyone if they are forced to hold with one hand when footholds break.\n\nIt is fortunate that Powell could leave under his own power-the consensus seems to be that an evacuation from this cave, with it's many tight places, would have been very difficult and time-consuming.",

    "incident_report": "At about 1 p.m. on Saturday, April 17, four cavers entered Buddy Penley's Cave in Bland County, Virginia. These were Bill Kelly, Mike Moore, Pete Sauvigne (31) and Bob Ulfers (20), from Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Sauvigne was by far the most experienced and was playing the role of leader. They proceeded down the 120 foot pit, the 30 foot cable ladder drop and the Crossover Pit. After exploring a bit, looking for a connection to Newberry's Cave, they started out. The trip in had taken four hours. At the 120 foot pit the noise of the waterfall had about doubled but they had planned for this (rain was expected) by rigging that drop so that one could get off at a constriction 90 feet up and serve as a relayer of communications as the rest came up. Sauvigne asked Moore to go up and fill this role. At about 5:15 p.m. he had reached the constriction and moved up over the edge and to the left to rig into the excess of the 200 foot rope used to rig the drop. At that point a 30 pound rock fell, presumably dislodged by Moore although he didn't notice such an occurrence. Below, Sauvigne was at the rope helping Ulfers put on his vertical rig. The rock, \"the size of a football,\" struck a blow to Ulfers' helmet, then to Sauvigne's arms and finally Ulfers' foot. Ulfers' helmet was knocked off by the blow and when Ulfers fell to the floor he struck his head, suffering further head and neck injuries. Both of Sauvigne's arms were broken and Ulfers was knocked unconscious. Sauvigne yelled for Moore to get help. Moore communicated that he would and took off. Toward the entrance the cave is complex and Moore had to take his time and several times chose wrong at a junction, retracing his steps after reaching a dead-end. His carbide lamp went out at one point, but was not difficult to relight. He reached the entrance about an hour and a half after the accident. Calls to the VPI Cave Club and NCRC got the rescue started. Meanwhile Kelly, who had been nearby, recharging his lamp, took charge of the injured cavers. Ulfer's neck injuries kept them from moving him. In the drafts at the bottom of the drop hypothermia became a problem. Ulfers was unconscious for about 10 minutes-when he came to he experienced nausea and rolled over a bit to vomit. Kelly took this opportunity to put some insulation under him. Using plastic bags and carbide lamps he then kept Ulfers as warm as possible. Both Sauvigne and Ulfers were in great pain. They passed the time in theological discussion. At 9:15 p.m. the first of the rescuers arrived at the cave. At 9:30 a group entered to bring medical supplies/expertise and a sleeping bag to the victims. Then a team entered to lay phone line. By 10:40 p.m. a phone line was set up to the accident site. After an initial examination, Ulfers appeared to have a scalp laceration, but no skull fracture; the shoulder pain seemed to indicate a broken clavical. He complained of pain in his left side and shoulder. His pupils were equal and reactive. Sauvigne was cold and appeared to have fractures of both forearms. While the victims were treated, the pit was rerigged for hauling and to bypass a narrow crawlway just above the pit. In the process it was found that the new rig site was somewhat unstable so there was some rock-fall danger. The medical team with the victims called for a special, flexible backboard, a KED, for Ulfers. This went down the drop at about midnight. At 12:43 a.m. Kelly was sent up the 120 foot drop. Meanwhile the best route to the entrance had been chosen and rigging was going on along this. At 4:20 a.m. Ulfers was brought up the 120. After being checked by the med techs he was transported to the entrance by a variety of caver-rescuers. He reached the entrance at 6:35 a.m. Sauvigne was being hauled up the 12 at that time and was transported to the entrance shortly after. Ulfers was flown to a hospital where he was listed in serious condition with a depressed skull fracture, two hairline fractures of the cervical spine and a broken foot. Sauvigne was found to have an open fracture of the left forearm and a compound fracture of the right forearm.",
    "incident_analysis": "There was a good deal of useful comment about this accident in the caver press. Sauvigne admits to being \"impatient to exit the cave\" such that he helped Ulfers rig in 1) while someone was still climbing above, and 2) directly in the rockfall path, where he had experienced rockfall before. Apparently they could have rigged in at a spot sheltered from rockfall. Ulfers points out that your helmet does not provide complete safety from rockfall. Certainly it saved his life-the MSA Comfo-cap experienced a collapsed suspension but the shell was intact. Still, the helmet was knocked from his head allowing further injuries when he struck the ground. Helmets should not come off in the process of an accident, and one should change or modify the chinstrap accordingly. Moss suggests that the presence of Kelly as an additional party member, able to stay with the victims and offer assistance, may have saved them from succumbing to hypothermia. In all, a good example of the power of a simple rockfall to wreak havoc, and of the necessity of a good caver-manned rescue network. For me, at least, it is easy to think of times I've braved rockfall just to speed things up a little.",

    "original_text": "Buddy Penley's Cave, Virginia\nApril 17, 1982\n\nAt about 1 p.m. on Saturday, April 17, four cavers entered Buddy Penley's Cave\nin Bland County, Virginia. These were Bill Kelly, Mike Moore, Pete Sauvigne (31)\nand Bob Ulfers (20), from Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Sauvigue was by far the\nmost experienced and was playing the role of leader.\nThey proceeded down the 120 foot pit, the 30 foot cable ladder drop and the\nCrossover Pit. After exploring a bit, looking for a connection to Newberry's Cave,\nthey started out. The trip in had taken four hours. At the 120 foot pit the noise of the\nwaterfall had about doubled but they had planned for this (rain was expected) by\nrigging that drop so that one could get off at a constriction 90 feet up and serve as a\nrelayer of communications as the rest came up.\nSauvigne asked Moore to go up and fill this role. At about 5:15 p.m. he had\nreached the constriction and moved up over the edge and to the left to rig into the\nexcess of the 200 foot rope used to rig the drop. At that point a 30 pound rock fell,\npresumably dislodged by Moore although he didn't notice such an occurrence.\nBelow, Sauvigne was at the rope helping Ulfers put on his vertical rig. The rock,\n\"the size of a football,\" struck a blow to Ulfers' helmet, then to Sauvigne's arms\nand finally Ulfers' foot. Ulfers' helmet was knocked off by the blow and when Ulfers\nfell to the floor he struck his head, suffering further head and neck injuries. Both of\nSauvigne's arms were broken and Ulfers was knocked unconscious.\nSauvigne yelled for Moore to get help. Moore communicated that he would and\ntook off. Toward the entrance the cave is complex and Moore had to take his time\nand several times chose wrong at a junction, retracing his steps after reaching a\ndead-end. His carbide lamp went out at one point, but was not difficult to relight.\nHe reached the entrance about an hour and a half after the accident. Calls to the\nVPI Cave Club and NCRC got the rescue started.\nMeanwhile Kelly, who had been nearby, recharging his lamp, took charge of the\ninjured cavers. Ulfer's neck injuries kept them from moving him. In the drafts at\nthe bottom of the drop hypothermia became a problem. Ulfers was unconscious for\nabout 10 minutes-when he came to he experienced nausea and rolled over a bit to\nvomit. Kelly took this opportunity to put some insulation under him. Using plastic\nbags and carbide lamps he then kept Ulfers as warm as possible. Both Sauvigne\nand Ulfers were in great pain. They passed the time in theological discussion.\nAt 9:15 p.m. the first of the rescuers arrived at the cave. At 9:30 a group entered\nto bring medical supplies/expertise and a sleeping bag to the victims. Then a team\nentered to lay phone line. By 10:40 p.m. a phone line was set up to the accident site.\nAfter an initial examination, Ulfers appeared to have a scalp laceration, but no\nskull fracture; the shoulder pain seemed to indicate a broken clavical. He\ncomplained of pain in his left side and shoulder. His pupils were equal and reactive.\nSauvigne was cold and appeared to have fractures of both forearms.\nWhile the victims were treated, the pit was rerigged for hauling and to bypass a\nnarrow crawlway just above the pit. In the process it was found that the new rig site\nwas somewhat unstable so there was some rock-fall danger.\nThe medical team with the victims called for a special, flexible backboard, a\nKED, for Ulfers. This went down the drop at about midnight. At 12:43 a.m. Kelly\nwas sent up the 120 foot drop. Meanwhile the best route to the entrance had been\nchosen and rigging was going on along this.\nAt 4:20 a.m. Ulfers was brought up the 120. After being checked by the med\ntechs he was transported to the entrance by a variety of caver-rescuers. He reached\nthe entrance at 6:35 a.m. Sauvigne was being hauled up the 12 at that time and was\ntransported to the entrance shortly after.\nUlfers was flown to a hospital where he was listed in serious condition with\na\ndepressed skull fracture, two hairline fractures of the cervical spine and a broken\nfoot. Sauvigue was found to have an open fracture of the left forearm and a\ncompound fracture of the right forearm.\nREFERENCES: 1) Pete Sauvigne Personal Communication August 30, 1982.\n2) Robert Rubin \"Two Injured Cave Explorers Rescued From Bland Cavern\"\nRoanoke Times April 19, 1982 pp A-1, 8.\n3) Caroline Kane \"Two Rescued From Bland Cave\" Virginian Leader (Pearisburg,\nVirginia) April 21, 1982 pp 1, 12.\n4) Chris Peacock \"Saved\" Roanoke Times April 28, 1982.\n5) Detlef Ulfers \"Accident in Buddy Penley Cave\" The Potomac Caver 25:5 May,\n1982 71.\n6) Betty Moss \"Rescue\" Bat Times 2:1 p 12.\n7) Editor \"Buddy Penley Rescue\" Tech Troglodyte Spring, 1982 pp 113-118,\n122-124.\n8) Robert Logan \"Cave Rescue\" Letter to Editor Roanoke Times Monday April 26,\n1982 A-6.\nANALYSIS: There was a good deal of useful comment about this accident in the\ncaver press. Sauvigne admits to being \"impatient to exit the cave\" such that he\nhelped Ulfers rig in 1) while someone was still climbing above, and 2) directly in the\nrockfall path, where he had experienced rockfall before. Apparently they could\nhave rigged in at a spot sheltered from rockfall.\nUlfers points out that your helmet does not provide complete safety from rockfall.\nCertainly it saved his life-the MSA Comfo-cap experienced a collapsed suspension\nbut the shell was intact. Still, the helmet was knocked from his head allowing\nfurther injuries when he struck the ground. Helmets should not come off in the\nprocess of an accident, and one should change or modify the chinstrap accordingly.\nMoss suggests that the presence of Kelly as an additional party member, able to\nstay with the victims and offer assistance, may have saved them from succumbing\nto hypothermia.\nIn all, a good example of the power of a simple rockfall to wreak havoc, and of the\nnecessity of a good caver-manned rescue network. For me, at least, it is easy to\nthink of times I've braved rockfall just to speed things up a little."

After four hours of exploring, they began to ascend the 185 foot entrance drop. The second caver going up, Terry Hill (25), was 75 feet from the surface and 35 feet above a sloping ledge that interrupts the drop, when a rock dislodged from a point 20-30 below. The rock, estimated to be \"between 60-70 lbs\" and \"the size of a car tire,\" struck the ledge and broke into several pieces which showered on those below. Everyone dove for shelter and no one was hit. The rope was checked by Hill for damage and there was no further incident.",
    "incident_analysis": "The rope had been anchored for convenience to an old donkey engine bolted to the bedrock near the pit. The wall down to the ledge at this point \"is exfoliating and in spots (is) unstable and loose.\" The group recognized that the rope should be rigged at some other point to avoid this part of the drop. Areas of loose rock should always be avoided. If any other anchor point was available, the first man down should have asked for the rope to be re-rigged, assuming he did not already know of the rotten wall.\n\nOn ascent, if a rock is dislodged and may have damaged the rope below a caver, the safer thing to do is to pull the rope up, inspecting it (as was done here), or rappel back down, watching for rope damage, rather than make those below ascend at their own risk.",

    "original_text": "Ogle Cave, New Mexico\nMay 16, 1982\n\nOn Saturday, May 16, 1982 five cavers entered Ogle Cave in Carlsbad Cavern\nNational Park in New Mexico. After four hours of exploring, they began to ascend\nthe 185 foot entrance drop. The second caver going up, Terry Hill (25), was 75 feet\nfrom the surface and 35 feet above a sloping ledge that interrupts the drop, when a\nrock dislodged from a point 20-30 below. The rock, estimated to be \"between 60-70\nlbs\" and \"the size of a car tire,\" struck the ledge and broke into several pieces\nwhich showered on those below. Everyone dove for shelter and no one was hit. The\nrope was checked by Hill for damage and there was no further incident.\nREFERENCE: William Bentley \"Incident, New Mexico, Ogle Cave\" Unpublished\nReport April, 1983 p.\nANALYSIS: The rope had been anchored for convenience to an old donkey engine\nbolted to the bedrock near the pit. The wall down to the ledge at this point \"is\nexfoliating and in spots (is) unstable and loose.\" The group recognized that the\nrope should be rigged at some other point to avoid this part of the drop. Areas of\nloose rock should always be avoided. If any other anchor point was available, the\nfirst man down should have asked for the rope to be re-rigged, assuming he did not\nalready know of the rotten wall.\nOn ascent, if a rock is dislodged and may have damaged the rope below a caver,\nthe safer thing to do is to pull the rope up, inspecting it (as was done here), or\nrappel back down, watching for rope damage, rather than make those below ascend\nat their own risk."

This ran to the right of a six inch diameter tree at the lip and back 50 feet to the rig point, a tree. A rope pad was rigged to a Jumar on the main line about five feet from the lip. There was insufficient webbing to rig the pad to a tree.\n\nAt the top, everyone was getting their rappel rigs on while Ralph Earlandson, the most experienced, was helping a novice to construct a climbing system. Greg Valent, the third experienced vertical caver, headed for Borden's Pit, 300 feet away, to rig it.\n\nTed Hartman (32) got his gear on, and went to the rope. He pulled the rope up four or five feet, to get below the Jumar, and applied a rack, using all five bars. While doing this he did not at any time inform Earlandson, the only really experienced one left on top, that he was getting ready to descend.\n\nAs he tried to back down the slope toward the lip, he had trouble getting the rope to move through the rack. Bill Watts, who was watching, suggested removing a bar. This was done but he was still struggling back toward the lip, feeding rope through the rack. At the lip, he jammed the bars up, readjusted the pad, and stepped down to a ledge three feet below the lip. It was now 11:30 a.m.\n\nLeaning back at a 30 degree angle, he tugged on the rack with both hands, spreading the bars. Suddenly his feet slipped off the ledge precipitating him into an uncontrolled descent. Watts saw the fall and yelled \"Belay!\"\n\nOn the bottom, Paterno \"heard something\" then the \"zip\" of the fall. He grabbed for the rope, and started to pull in slack. The rope became tight in his hands at the same time as Hartman hit the bottom.\n\nThe victim came to rest with the rack supporting the upper part of his body about ten inches above the floor. There was no movement. His eyes stared straight ahead. Paterno ran to him, held up his head and called to him. After a minute Hartman groaned; after five minutes he became coherent and tried to sit up. Paterno stopped him and checked for \"motor control\" in all four extremities. Then he helped him out of the fall line.\n\nTo get a better opinion on injuries, Paterno yelled to to those above to send Watts, a CPR, down.

The sleeping bag was placed under him, the blanket over him and the sweater served as a pillow. Meanwhile the victim's breathing was short, painful and labored, with pulse fluctuating between 60 and 100.

    "incident_report": "At 11 a.m. on June 12, 1982, Kevin Bruno, Danny Dible, Greg McNamera and Dave Black entered Roppel Cave, near Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky. At about 4 a.m. (13th), after ten hours of surveying below the Rift, they headed out. At the ascent of the Rift, a deep canyon that cuts across Yahoo Avenue, Black was last. This ascent involves a 20 and a 46 foot drop, permanently rigged with a single piece of PMI. All four made it up the 20, Black finding that the upper ascender knot of his 3-knot rig was grabbing, causing him to have to force it up. This caused some fraying but at the top, all three strands of the 5/16th Goldline were still intact. Before starting up the 46 he retied the frayed ascender knot so that the worn place would not abrade further. The first three proceeded up the 46 and to the dry spot about 500 feet further on. Black went up. As he tried to cross the upper lip, however, the frayed sling broke. As he grabbed the rope to keep himself upright, the other two knots released, and he fell 'at nearly freefall speed' back down the rope. Black let go of the rope and wrapped his legs around it, slightly decreasing his speed. The other two knots then either abraded or melted off the rope and he fell free, landing on the bedrock shelf between drops in a three-inch pool of water. The force of the fall had been taken mainly by his heels and buttocks. After a minute or so he moved out of the water onto a mud bank. He could discover no obviously broken bones but it was very painful to put weight on his heels. His lamp and eyeglasses had been knocked off so he got out a flashlight and located the missing items. The lamp had to be reassembled but was finally got going. After more than half an hour the others returned and lowered a climbing rig. With this Black made it up the drop. It was so painful for Black to put weight on his heels that he had to crawl much of the walking passage to the entrance. The two miles took four hours; they emerged at 11 a.m. Sunday (13th). Black's injuries proved to be only bruises.",
    "incident_analysis": "Obviously Black's vertical rig was inadequate. A vertical rig must continue to support the caver if one of its components fails. Even if the slippage of the bottom two knots was due to some action of Black's, such panic reflexes should have no effect on a proper rig. The main point here, I feel, is that parties should pay close attention to the last man in line, especially at a point where a serious accident may occur, like a vertical drop. The last man has no one still coming to help him if he gets in trouble, as others in a strung-out party would. In this case, if Black had sustained a serious cut, he could easily have bled to death before the others got tired of waiting and returned. A rule in caving should be: Always keep track of the person behind you. If everyone in a party is doing this, the party is 'together.'

    "original_text": "Roppel Cave, Kentucky\nJune 12, 1982\n\nAt 11 a.m. on June 12, 1982, Kevin Bruno, Danny Dible, Greg McNamera and\nDave Black entered Roppel Cave, near Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky.\nAt about a.m. (13th), after ten hours of surveying below the Rift, they headed out.\nAt the ascent of the Rift, a deep canyon that cuts across Yahoo Avenue, Black\nwas last. This ascent involves a 20 and a 46 foot drop, permanently rigged with a\nsingle piece of PMI. All four made it up the 20, Black finding that the upper\nascender knot of his 3-knot rig was grabbing, causing him to have to force it up.\nThis cased some fraying but at the top, all three strands of the 5/16th Goldline were\nstill intact. Before starting up the 46 he retied the frayed ascender knot so that the\nworn place would not abraid further.\nThe first three proceeded up the 46 and to the dry spot about 500 feet further on.\nBlack went up. As he tried to cross the upper lip, however, the frayed sling broke.\nAs he grabbed the rope to keep himself upright, the other two knots released, and\nhe fell \"at nearly freefall speed\" back down the rope. Black let go of the rope and\nwrapped his legs around it, slightly decreasing his speed. The other two knots then\neither abraided or melted off the rope and he fell free, landing on the bedrock shelf\nbetween drops in a three inch pool of water.\nThe force of the fall had been taken mainly by his heels and buttocks. After a\nminute or so he moved out of the water onto a mud bank. He could discover no\nobviously broken bones but it was very painful to put weight on his heels.\nHis lamp and eyeglasses had been knocked off so he got out a flashlight and\nlocated the missing items. The lamp had to be reassembled but was finally got\ngoing. After more than half and hour the others returned and lowered a climbing\nrig. With this Black made it up the drop. It was so painful for Black to put weight on\nhis heels that he had to crawl much of the walking passage to the entrance. The two\nmiles took four hours; they emerged at 11 a.m. Sunday (13th). Black's injuries\nproved to be only bruises.\nREFERENCES: 1) Dave Black Personal Communication May 12, 1983 2 p.\n2) Dave Black Trip Report-Roppel Cave unpublished undated\nANALYSIS: Obviously Black's vertical rig was inadequate. A vertical rig must\ncontinue to support the caver if one of it's components fails. Even if the slippage of\nthe bottom two knots was due to some action of Black's, such panic reflexes should\nhave no effect on a proper rig.\nThe main point here, I feel, is that parties should pay close attention to the last\nman in line, especially at a point where a serious accident may occur, like a vertical\ndrop. The last man has no one still coming to help him if he gets in trouble, as\nothers in a strung-out party would. In this case, if Black had sustained a serious cut,\nhe could easily have bled to death before the others got tired of waiting and\nreturned. A rule in caving should be: Always keep track of the person behind you. If\neveryone in a party is doing this, the party is \"together.\" A lack of togetherness is\na common occurrence in caving parties."

Kisling, having not been in the cave before, thought he would check the crawl first. Since he didn't have a wetsuit, the two agreed he would be the determiner as to whether or not they should continue. Kisling sized up the situation and determined that it wasn't all that wet and proceeded down the crawl. Presently he came to a point where the down-sloping passage reaches a pool of water, 6-8 inches deep with 12-16 inches of air space above which allows the caver a chance to stay out of the water. While bridging across the pool, Kisling's cave pack became submerged in the pool and a great explosion occurred, knocking him out of his position above the pool and into the water. His lamp was extinguished. Wolff was some distance behind, so in the dark Kisling had to grope in his pack for his second source of light, an electric head lamp. The explosion had broken the lens to the light, but luckily, not the bulb. However, the battery pack was badly damaged as well, with a broken latch and hinge. Still in the dark, Kisling found the four batteries and assembled the pack by wrapping the power cord around it to hold things together.

Movement for a hypothermia victim no\nlonger produces much body heat and may use up the last of the victim's energy,\ncausing death."

Virginia to do a six mile through trip, coming out the Canadian Hole entrance to this very extensive cave system. This is somewhat normal caving, including water crawls as well as borehole, until the exit is reached where one must negotiate a series of drops, of 12, 24, 8, 15, and 35 feet. At least the first four were waterfalls at this time. Before the trip started, these had been rigged, a single rope strung over the first three, the 15 left as an unbelayed free climb (5.4) and another rope on the 35 foot entrance drop. The first three were rigged with the rope laying right in the waterfall.\n\nOnly the leader and one other wore wetsuits; several had no helmet-mounted electric light, one had only a carbide lamp-no backup. At least some had left their regular vertical rigs behind, bringing a lighter set up to save weight on the long trip. One planned to use prussiks but had no previous experience.\n\nThe trip as far as the exit drops was not without incident. The leaders moved rapidly, others tried to keep up and the caver second most experienced in that cave brought up the rear. At least a couple tried to maintain the pace of the leaders but weren't used to it and tired. The group became very strung out, causing confusion at some points to those unfamiliar with the cave.\n\nAt the exit waterfalls, cavers put on any extra dry clothes and they stated up. The leader went up the first two drops and was quickly out of sight. Two cavers then proceeded up drop 1 with some difficulty. The next caver had never used prussiks before. Six feet above the plunge pool this caver got into the falls, the carbide lamp was extinguished. The prussiks then slipped and the victim slid down into the pool. It was quickly decided to haul this caver up. Fortunately the victim is of small build so this was possible. The three then proceeded to drop 2 while the others followed. Four cavers still in good condition proceeded up drop 2 and hauled up the victim and another caver who had grown too tired to do the waterfalls. The original victim was by now nearly exhausted.\n\nDrop 3 was negotiated with a 3-man shoulder stand. The victim was now shaking violently as hypothermia set in. They moved on to drop 4, the free climb were it was obvious that another rope was needed to get the victim up. The leader went on out and was back in 45 minutes with a rope and down vest. With the rope as a belay, the victim was allowed to climb up. At the entrance pit, the victim was hauled up by a 6-person surface team. To save time, everyone else was hauled up as well.",
    "incident_analysis": "Bruce Randall makes the point that the party would have been stronger at the drops if the pace were slower and if there had been no confusion through the group being strung out. He goes on to say that the victim succumbed to a combination of factors: \"1. only been caving 3 or 4 times before, 2. poorly dressed for ascending a a rope hanging in a waterfall, 3. not familiar with knots on a wet rope, and 4. unduly tired from having pushed unnecessarily to chase some rabbits through the cave.\"\n\nThe group was quite unprepared for the waterfalls. Vertical rigs were varied and those using knots in some cases did not know how they would work in wet conditions. There were few electric head lamps and the carbide cavers apparently had been using muddy cave water in their lamps. This causes sediment plugging of the water drip-in caves with muddy water always carry carbide water. Lack of wetsuits was another problem. A waterfall series can be counted on to provide very slow going to a large group with some inexperienced cavers, so wetsuits would have helped.\n\nBut the best solution, that would have eliminated all real problems, would have been to go in Canadian Hole and rig the drops so that the ropes lay out of the water flow.\n\nWhen taking novices or cavers inexperienced in a technique required for that particular trip, it is always a question as to whether they can make it or not and don't forget that their welfare depends on your judgement, not on their decision to go, ignorant as they are of the conditions to be met. If it had been possible, time-wise, it would have been good to take the party down the exit series and back out SO they could experience the conditions and be able to improve their equipment.

Shortly after noon, they rigged the 227-foot entrance drop of Vast Caverns in Jackson County, Alabama, and Garrett and King rappelled in. They had only two sets of ascenders, so Machen waited at the top\u2014Garrett would ascend, and Machen would rappel in with Garrett's ascenders for King to use. At about 1:25 p.m., Machen rappelled in, unclipped from the rope, and moved to where King was sitting, about 25 feet from the bottom of the rope, 'partly protected by a 50-foot high rock wall.' King removed her hard hat for comfort, and the two sat talking. Without warning, a rock fell, brushing Machen's right shoulder and striking King, who screamed. Machen calmed the victim down somewhat and found that she appeared to have a broken forearm and an injured, bloody leg, with a minor abrasion causing some facial bleeding. Machen yelled for Garrett, and he descended with a pack. King was covered with a space blanket. Garrett then went for help, while Machen stayed with the victim. Machen moved the victim under a ledge for more protection and administered what first-aid he could, making a sling for the arm and wrapping her in the space blanket. Garrett returned in two hours and called for his pack so that he could rig the pit with a pulley for the evacuation. At 4:50 p.m., the rescue commenced. An ambulance service person rappelled in, and he and Machen splinted the injured arm and leg and got the victim into a Stokes litter, ready for hauling. The Stokes was rigged with the rescuer directly above it for guidance while Machen exerted some control from below with a line attached to the litter. As the litter neared the top, a 3-cell flashlight came out of the rescuer's harness but missed Machen, below. The victim reached Jackson County Hospital at 8:05 p.m. The arm had a broken bone, but the leg only a deep puncture wound.",

Teal points out that the pit has obvious instability around the upper part. Since falling rocks can bound laterally for some distance, 25 feet is not far enough removed from the drop for safety.

    "incident_report": "On Friday, November 25, Larry Ritchey (34) began a projected three day hike through the winter wilderness on the north slopes of Mount Hood in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. He was warmly dressed, with long underwear, wool pants and shirt, parka, mittens and rubber-soled boots, and equipped with food and shelter. He left an itinerary with friends, planning to be back by Tuesday the 29th. On Sunday the weather produced snow and as he slowly snow-shoed along, he suddenly plunged into a snow-covered hole, falling 12-14 feet, landing on his back. His pack prevented injury but, after lighting one of several candles he had, he found himself at the bottom of a pit about ten feet in diameter, with overhung walls, with a stream of water swirling along the floor. It came from a passage which he explored for 200 feet without finding an exit. Moreover, there was no air movement so he returned to the pit. After eating (his stove was smashed so food was eaten without cooking) he got out a 30 foot rope he had brought and realized a rock tied to one end might catch in the boulders outside if thrown up through the hole. For the next three days he threw his makeshift grapple to no avail. The first two nights he slept standing up, feet in the water. The third night he hung in a loop of the rope, suspended from a tree root. On Tuesday evening Ritchie's absence was reported to the Hood River Sheriff's Office. On Wednesday searchers on snowmobiles traced his hike plan but new snow had covered his tracks and fate. Helicopters were ineffective due to fog and bad weather. Ritchie was on his own. By Thursday he had consumed all of his food and was beginning to slip into hypothermia, with slurred speech and an unsteadiness to his limbs. But that day he got lucky. The rock at the end of the rope snagged the limb of a dead tree, and he hauled himself free. It was raining but he dared not stop. He slogged ten miles to Highway 35, caught a ride and finally was safe.",

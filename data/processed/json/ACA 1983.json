    "incident_report": "On February 19, 1983 a group of ten cavers entered October Ten Cave in Savage Cove, west of McMinville, Tennessee. This included Joe Douglas (late 20's), Richard Greer (late 20's), Roger Ling, Frank Bogle, Tom Pride (early 20's), Doug Luther, Bryan Ball (18), Ed Holladay (20), Jim Hodson (42) and Sue Loveless (32). Although this was only the fourth trip into the cave, the weather had been dry for the past month so some apparently expected dry conditions. Three had wet suit tops, one had a full wet suit but the rest were relying on wool clothes and garbage bags and had dry shirts or sweaters to put on after the entrance sewers. Despite the lack of rain the flow at the entrance was much greater than before. It was impossible to get into the entrance, a small hole at the bottom of a sinkhole, without getting soaked. Inside, dry passage leads quickly to a 43 foot pit. From the bottom of this another dry passage leads to a waterfall dome where the continuation is a stream crawl for 200 feet to a series of wet climb-downs, of 15, 10 and 7 feet. A wet bellycrawl then leads 20 feet to 20 feet of narrow canyon, and a 24 foot, wet pit. From the bottom of this there is a climb up flowstone into the main borehole of the cave.\n\nAt the 24 foot pit the rope was rigged to a rock the cavers had jammed into a crack and several chert projections, with the rope hanging in the water spray. Several had descended when some of the rig point failed, dropping a caver a foot or so. They called up to have the rigging checked. Another descended, but when Richard Greer, the last, got over the lip, he suddenly dropped ten feet, his head hitting the wall. He was 'left hanging upside-down in the waterfall, dazed. Then more of the rigging failed, and he fell to the bottom.\n\nThe others heard the fall and quickly reached the victim who was bleeding from the wrist and mouth. His hard hat and lamp were retrieved and they climbed into the dry borehole. Greer was apparently OK, so they proceeded with their explorations and mapping.\n\nAfter some time two headed out: Greer who was quite sore and Roger Ling who had been sick most of the prior week and was starting to feel weak. Ling twisted his ankle in a hasty rappel down the flowstone from the dry borehole but could still walk. At the 24 foot pit, Ling ascended to find the chockstone still holding but most of the chert projections had failed. Since they were getting cold, they continued on out, Greer using an emergency flashlight since his carbide striker was wet. At 6:15 p.m. they reached the cars.\n\nTom Pride started up with a system using two knots and a shoulder Gibbs. The climb was in the waterfall and Pride had not climbed in water before. He passed a ledge ten feet below the top, slowed and then stopped about five feet from the lip as his strength gave out and his hands and arms became numb and useless. Joe Douglas tried to talk him up, then down. Realizing the victim's helplessness and danger, hanging as he was directly in the water flow, Douglas got on rope and went up to help him.\n\nAt the ledge he got partly off rope, worked Pride's system and got him down to the ledge. Pride was 'disoriented and convinced he was going to die.' He was rigged for rappel and descended with a bottom belay regulating his speed. He was then helped up the flowstone slope to a dry, sandy spot where he was dressed in dry clothes and garbage bags, given hot food and water, and put between two persons for warmth. He recovered significantly but it was obvious he would need outside help to get out.\n\nDouglas, meanwhile, continued to the top of the 24, arriving with no arm strength and quite chilled. Ed Holladay climbed up and he and Douglas started out to get help. Douglas quickly proved too weak and was sent back to stay with the others. Holladay reached the first two, at the cars, at about 8 p.m.\n\nThe calls for help were made and by 1 a.m. it arrived in force. This included The Nashville Grotto Cave Rescue Team, local rescue squads, civil defense, State Police, etc. Rescuers began entering at 3 a.m. and worked to rig the drops and climbs with the rope out of the water flow. Wetsuits, heat sources and hot food were taken in to ready the victims for exit. A hot air respirator was set up at the entrance to deal with hypothermia victims. The cavers caring for Pride were found to be in relatively good condition, however, and all were out by 10 a.m. (February 20). Body temperatures were down but only one, with 92 degree temperature, used the hot air respirator. Greer had suffered a mild concussion.",
    "incident_analysis": "It may be that this group was too large for proper, expeditious movement through a wet-pitch series. Further, you are clearly taking chances when cavers who are inexperienced, weak from sickness and/or inequipped enter a wet cave.\nThe rigging at the 24 foot drop can be said to be faulty since on partial failure large amounts of slack had to be taken up by the remaining anchor points. One can rig to multiple points without producing slack on partial failure. Also, since it was known from the previous trip that there were no decent natural anchors at the 24, a bolt kit should have been brought. Hanging it out on chert nodules is for original push trips, not for a ten-man mapping party.\nStill, in the face of difficulties, this party handled itself very well and was complimented by rescuers for having kept themselves warm and for being in relatively good shape for exiting the cave. The rescue seemed to be well-manned, coordinated and expeditiously carried out.",

    "incident_report": "At about 11:00 a.m. on Saturday, April 23, a group of eight cavers entered Precinct 11 Cave in Rockcastle County, Kentucky. These were co-leaders Gary Bush (45) and Jack Hissong (45), Jeffery Gardner (27), Mary Gratsch (26), Jacques Ramsey (26), Mark Rocklin (26), Jill Vedder (24), and John Wisher (36). The trip was part of an ongoing mapping project by the Greater Cincinnati Grotto. Of the eight, six were experienced, while two were novices.\n\nOver four miles of passage had been mapped in Precinct 11 since its discovery in 1979. The entrance passage is about 200 feet long, and is an overflow to the main cave stream. Under normal conditions 100 feet of this is a near sump, 34 inches high at the lowest point with 30 inches of water depth. Beyond this passage are the larger, higher level passages of the main cave. At the entrance pool was a staff gauge to indicate the entrance passage water level. A level of 21 inches would indicate that the passage was sumped. An emergency equipment cache had been placed beyond the sump area.\n\nIt had been raining lightly the previous night and day and the rain continued as the group prepared to enter. The gauge stood at 18 inches (three inches of air space). The flooding possibilities had been discussed at camp Friday evening and the experienced members felt they \"knew\" the cave well enough to feel it was safe under present conditions. Two of the original ten were not convinced, however, and elected to pursue other objectives. At 11:00 a.m. the group of eight entered the cave.\n\nA National Weather Service bulletin Friday night predicted rain and possible thundershowers in the Rockcastle County area for Saturday, diminishing in the evening. A low pressure system was moving east across the gulf states with the possibility of heavy rains. Indeed, up to two inches had fallen in some areas of the county by early Sunday.\n\nOnce inside the entrance passage, the group went through the normal procedure of changing to dry clothes, brought along in plastic bags. Two had wetsuit tops. They then split up to pursue various objectives. At about 7:00 p.m. they rejoined and started out. As they neared the entrance passage, it was obvious that the flow was up. They pushed on to a total sump, then retreated to the high ledge with the emergency cache and settled in to wait out the flood. Their dry clothes had gotten wet so these were wrung out and put back on to dry. Plastic bags were put on and extra equipment was inventoried two plastic bags, candles, carbide, two cans of Spam, one candy bar, and two bags of M & M's.\n\nThe two who had not entered the cave became concerned when Sunday dawned with no sign of their companions. At the cave they found the gauge showing twice normal depth. At 2:50 p.m. they called for help. The Kentucky Cave and Rock Rescue Team (KCRRT) in Bowling Green was alerted and various cavers and divers were contacted. KCRRT personnel arrived at 8:30 p.m. Sunday, assessed the situation and called NCRC, requesting more divers.\n\nRescue squad divers, untrained in cave diving, were present but deemed unsuitable and were not used. Local media coverage began at this time.\n\nAt 4:00 a.m. on Monday, George Veni arrived. At 5:30 he made a recon dive with standard gear plus one day pack and an ammo box containing food, stove and hot packs. Veni encountered 100 feet of sump, partly a crawl, with visibility of one to one-and-a-half feet. He proceeded 700 feet, mostly walking, to a second sump, dove this and a third, before turning back at a fourth sump. At sump one he located a side passage which was the correct route, which appeared to sump also. Tying off his guideline, he exited the cave (11:30 a.m.).\n\nThe possibility of a major disaster and a lack of other newsworthy items now greatly increased news coverage.\n\nEarly that morning a request had been made for pumps and two coal mining companies, Mountain Clay and Lee Company, supplied five 500 gallon-per-minute pumps; four pumps plus crews arrived at 5:30 a.m. and the fifth at 10:30 a.m. These were set in operation at 9:30 and soon lowered the water level several inches at which level it remained steady, still sumped.\n\nThe trapped cavers, meanwhile, experienced at least some difficulty in keeping warm. After the first day in the 53 degree cave they began huddling together to conserve and share body heat. Still, a couple of them later described shivering nearly all the time. At around noon on Monday the water level had noticeably decreased, so three headed down to have a look at the sump. They found it still closed but encountered Veni's dive line and could hear the pumps working outside. They left a note and retreated to the bivouac.\n\nVeni had been startled by the sound of the pumps while exiting from his recon and had dropped his guide reel. No further dive could proceed until another reel arrived. At 3:30 p.m. Monday more cave divers arrived, were briefed, and at 4:45 p.m. Maegerlein and Forbes entered, followed Veni's line and found the note left by the trapped cavers, indicating that they were all safe. The divers returned with the note. At 7:30 p.m. Hudson and Wilson entered with supplies for the victims while the first pair of divers entered, retrieved gear stashed by Veni, and took that to the trapped group. At 10:00 p.m. Hudson and Wilson brought the group warm clothes and sleeping bags. The group was told to expect to be brought out at 1:00 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, at 9:00 p.m. a six-inch, 2500 gallon per minute pump was installed. Difficulty was experienced keeping the intake from cavitating, especially since carbon monoxide levels from pump exhaust were high around the entrance restricting divers from working on the hoses for more than ten minutes at a time. The bigger pump soon began to lower the water level.\n\nThe last dive, at 10:00 p.m., revealed that the exhaust fumes were entering the cave so Lee Company workers built a canvas curtain around the pumps allowing fire department fans to keep the air around the entrance fresh.\n\nAt 5:00 a.m. Tuesday another six-inch pump was installed. By 9:00 a.m. the water level was judged low enough to bring the trapped cavers out. It was decided to go ahead and do so since the bearings were going on one of the six-inch pumps. As soon as the victims were reached, four were started out with a diver staying with the other four. The first four came out at 11:00 a.m. and the second group at noon, with two-and-a-half to three inches of air space. They had been trapped some seventy hours. Fifteen minutes after the pumps were shut down the cave was again sumped.",
    "incident_analysis": "The cavers emerged to prolonged media coverage, coverage that had continued throughout their entrapment. Much editorializing has occurred in the caver press because of this and most express dismay and the wish to avoid such in the future. How to do this? Simple don't get trapped in caves! For no matter how simple the situation is, the masses appreciate a good story and the news media is only too ready to provide it. In the case here, the cavers must be criticized they entered a cave with only four inches of air space during bad weather and their only knowledge of flooding was personal experience, not detailed hydrologic analysis. The reaction of a cave to a given weather situation is not necessarily simple and may never be understood through casual observation.\n\nIn other words, the news media didn't create the situation, the cavers did.\n\nSo why did they go ahead? The psychology of such was discussed in a Dayton Area Speleological Society (DASS) editorial. For one thing, you are coerced if you have only one objective cave, no alternatives. You are also coerced if the objective is very important to the group. Also, the fact that they had gotten away with entering during light rain before gave them the confidence that they could do it again.\n\nThe reaction of a cave to rain will depend on recent conditions to a large extent, as the Schindel report states. If the ground is saturated, the effect of a light rain is much greater than if the ground is dry. Moreover, once you are in the cave, you won't know if the rain has gotten worse.\n\nThe DASS editorial suggests that, should the pumps have failed, or not been available, SCUBA methods would have had to be used to evacuate the group since more rain was forecast for Wednesday and Thursday. Schindel, et. al., point out that the peculiarity of the entrance passage water, being blocked from the main flow of the cave stream by rocks and sediment, is all that allowed the pumps to lower the water level. In most circumstances the pumping would not work.\n\nTo quote the Schindel report, \"A good, safe rule of thumb is to completely avoid caving in base level passages during periods of questionable weather conditions.\nThe extensive news coverage revealed some interesting information concerning the cost of rescues. The rescue involved more than 150 individuals State Police, volunteer firemen, amateur radio operators, divers, mine workers, etc. The Rockcastle County Rescue Squad estimated their costs at $7,000 to $8,000, while the pumping equipment was estimated by Mountain Clay and Lee Co. to cost $15,000 to $20,000. So the bad judgement regarding the question of possible entrapment in this case cost society tens of thousands of dollars. And that spent by emergency relief organizations on such occasions is that much not available for later disasters. And don't forget, you can't tell someone not to rescue you - they will anyway, for our society demands it.",

A 200 foot rope was rigged to a tree at the top of the sink which the group thought would just reach the bottom. To be sure, the first caver, Rudy Pruszko, would descend already rigged for ascent. He also carried his cave pack, a camera and a 6-volt hand lantern, all slung over his shoulders, about 20-30 pounds, total. At a ledge 30-40 feet down he still couldn't see if the rope reached bottom. Pruszko descended 20-50 feet further and saw the rope end short of the bottom. He let those above know, then changed over to ascend. He soon called up that he was tiring, then that he was being pulled over backwards, and finally that he was, indeed, hanging upside down. Pruszko was using a method recommended by Gosset of rigging the box at the waist so that one ascends with the body horizontal-the weight of pack, camera, and lantern had pulled him upside down. These were now tangled and could not be jettisoned. One caver on top ran to their van for a second rope of 150 feet. Campers nearby were recruited and a call went to the NSS Convention campground for NCRC rescuers. There seemed to be a lot of manpower on the scene SO they attached the 150 to the main line with Jumars and hauled Pruszko up to the ledge where he attached one end of the extra rope to his chest harness and was pulled upright. He was then hauled the rest of the way out. NCRC rescuers arrived a few minutes later.",
    "incident_analysis": "It is difficult to understand why one would want to rig an ascender box at the waist so that you are forced to ascend with your body horizontal, and your upper body unsupported. First, the bends that either the slings to your feet or the main line are forced into should create more friction than a standing upright system and secondly you must constantly exert force to hold your head and upper body up. Still, vertical systems are a personal preference sort of thing and what is right for one is not for another. The obvious mistake here is the gear taken by the first man down. Since a problem with the rope being too short was anticipated, the carrying of a lot of gear is wrong. Indeed, the first man down any drop can expect any number of difficulties (rope hung up, tangled or chopped, etc.) and should be as unencumbered as possible. It is reportedly a European technique to always do SRT with packs and gear on a tether, hung below the climber. An interesting point here is the lack of visibility of ropes currently in use. I had an opportunity recently to use a rope dyed bright orange - it was much easier to see what it was doing below you. In fact, as I descended, the first thing visible on the bottom was the rope. It would make a lot of sense if all caving rope were dyed a bright color.",

    "incident_report": "On Saturday morning, July 23, 1983 a group of eight divers began operations at La Cueva Manantial del las Aguas Frias, near the Manati River in Puerto Rico. The cave is a resurgence with an entrance 40 feet high by 30 feet wide with the ceiling coming right down into the pool of water at the back, some five or six feet deep. In the side of this pool is a hole, some two feet high and three to four feet wide leading to a \"tunnel-like conduit angling downward for some 700 feet at a 15 degree angle, then upward another 1240 feet into the shaft of a vertical cave on the other side of the mountain. Each diver had a single tank with 20 minutes air supply. Diving was in progress when surface members became concerned that Gilberto Vazquez Cabrera (25) had not appeared after his 20 minute period. On the way back from his exploration he experienced problems with his air, became separated from his partner and was not seen again. His companion searched as long as he dared, then surfaced. Other team members dove in and searched but Cabrera could not be found. The NSS was called and this produced two Florida cave diving experts, Henry Nicholson and Wes Skiles, via Air Force transport. Subsequent searches produced traces of the missing diver but no body. At 130 feet from the entrance a knife, a piece of lanyard, and a tether hook attached to a shorn piece of lifeline were found.",
    "incident_analysis": "According to Skiles the basic mistake was the failure to save two-thirds of a tank for the return trip and failure to stay out of deep, silty places such as this. Skiles theorizes that the victim \"may have been pushed upward into a ceiling crack, of which there are many, by a loss of buoyancy control. The less water you have above you the more the pressure decreases and once wedged up against a crack in the ceiling the decreased pressure forces you upward into the crack which may be full of all kinds of debris-if that happens you are in serious trouble.\"",

    "original_text": "Manantial de las Aguas Frias, Puerto Rico\nJuly 23, 1983\n\nOn Saturday morning, July 23, 1983 a group of eight divers began operations\nat La Cueva Manantial del las Aguas Frias, near the Manati River in Puerto Rico.\nThe cave is a resurgence with an entrance 40 feet high by 30 feet wide with the\nceiling coming right down into the pool of water at the back, some five or six feet\ndeep. In the side of this pool is a hole, some two feet high and three to four feet\nwide leading to a \"tunnel-like conduit angling downward for some 700 feet at a\n15 degree angle, then upward another 1240 feet into the shaft of a vertical cave\non the other side of the mountain.\nEach diver had a single tank with 20 minutes air supply. Diving was in\nprogress when surface members became concerned that Gilberto Vazquez\nCabrera (25) had not appeared after his 20 minute period. On the way back from\nhis exploration he experienced problems with his air, became separated from his\npartner and was not seen again. His companion searched as long as he dared,\nthen surfaced. Other team members dove in and searched but Cabrera could not\nbe found.\nThe NSS was called and this produced two Florida cave diving experts, Henry\nNicholson and Wes Skiles, via Air Force transport.\nSubsequent searches produced traces of the missing diver but no body. At\n130 feet from the entrance a knife, a piece of lanyard, and a tether hook attached\nto a shorn piece of lifeline were found.\nReference: Gino Ponti \"Search Abandoned for Student Lost in Cave Pool'' 'San\nJuan Star Wed July 27, 1983 p 16.\nAnalysis: According to Skiles the basic mistake was the failure to save two-thirds\nof a tank for the return trip and failure to stay out of deep, silty places such as\nthis.\nSkiles theorizes that the victim \"may have been pushed upward into a ceiling\ncrack, of which there are many, by a loss of buoyancy control. The less water you\nhave above you the more the pressure decreases and once wedged up against a\ncrack in the ceiling the decreased pressure forces you upward into the crack\nwhich may be full of all kinds of debris-if that happens you are in serious\ntrouble.'"

    "incident_report": "Late Saturday evening, October 1, a group of six cavers entered a cave at Driebelbis in Berks County, Pennsyvania, near Kutztown. At about 2 a.m. Robert E. Scott (36) was 75 feet from the entrance making his way through a narrow vertical crevice as the group exited. The crevice, some 80 feet high and 12 inches wide, narrowed to 7 or 8 inches in the middle, then became wider again below. Scott's hand slipped, his body dropped down, and he suddenly found himself wedged, left side down, in the middle portion. In that position he could not help himself-the sides and projections were all rounded and slimy with mud. He could gain no purchase-he was trapped.\nFor about 8 hours his companions tried unsuccessfully to free him. At 9:30 a.m. Sunday they went for outside help.\nFor some time volunteers from four fire departments labored to free the victim. The NCRC was called and 14 trained personnel were flown in from Pittsburgh, arriving late Sunday afternoon.\nAt first Scott was \"in good spirits\" but this deteriorated as Sunday wore on, and he became irrational and abusive to rescuers. The victim was an epileptic and was twice given medication to prevent seizures. This did not change his mood, however. With a line strung through the passage above him and slings around him, attempts were made to lift him vertically but as soon as a bit of progress was made he would begin to thrash wildly, defeating further action.\nInstrumentation was set up outside and sensors were attached to the victim such that his vital signs could be monitored. Heat packs, high intensity lights and hair dryers running off extension cords and blowing up the victims pants legs and sleeves, kept him warm. It was possible to feed him and at various times he was given coffee, broth, hot dogs and doughnuts. A request to use tranquilizers or sedation was refused by doctors directing the paramedics.\nRescuers worked constantly, trying to figure out a method of freeing the victim. Inflatable air bags were positioned under him in hopes of raising him when they were inflated. His body was greased, the walls were lined with plastic sheet-nothing worked. Meanwhile the victim screamed abuse at his potential saviors.\nThe need for permission for a sedative was thought sufficiently important that rescuers attempted to circumvent the local medical authority by patching into a local phone line to call a caver/doctor in California to get permission.\nAt about 7 a.m., Monday morning, however, as the victim delivered yet another tantrum, the vital signs ceased and Scott lost consciousness. Oxygen and \"heated intravenous infusions\" were administered to no avail.\n'Painful'' methods of extraction were then put into service using the high line, strung above the victim, and the slings around his body, dragging him up and out. He was finally freed at 12:25 p.m. Hopes that he had lapsed into deep hypothermia proved to be unfounded and he was pronounced dead shortly after.",
    "incident_analysis": "The coroner pronounced the cause of death to be \"congestive heart failure due to irreversible shock. A heart attack \"brought on by physical stress and pressure on his chest after 29 hours underground.' The stress was cited as due to cold and fear as well as compression. The coroner also said that the man's epilepsy was not a factor.\nSo here is a victim, only 75 feet from the entrance, in an a narrow crevice, yet accessible from above and below, being kept warm, given food and drink with vital signs monitored, yet he dies. To the rescuers it was his attitude, his state of panic and angry irrationality that hindered them. To an outside observer it might seem that lack of permission for sedation was the key factor. Perhaps the rescuers should have gone ahead with somewhat painful methods and accepted a few contusions and abrasions as the price of successful extrication. Perhaps they were too humane. Yet they thought they had a stable victim who in time could be extricated in spite of himself. It is certainly a sad set of circumstances.\nThe only criticism I can think of is the choice of food and drink. Solid food might be difficult to swallow in a prone position and be inhaled instead, resulting in suffocation. Also, coffee, unless decaffinated, is a stimulant-just the wrong thing for an excitable victim such as Scott.\nA word about the victim's seemingly strange state of mind. I believe rescuers should always look for strange attitudes and irrationality in trapped victims. Claustrophobia tends to disappear in active cavers SO we forget about it. Yet if anything might cause it to surface, it would be physical renetrapment-constriction of the chest, the stifling of your breathing, tons or rock ready to crush you.",

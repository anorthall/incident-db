FROM THE EDITOR
Dear Members,
As many of you may know the NSS has been facing a budget
shortfall and it looked like the ACA that Bonny Armstrong had just
prepared was going to be relegated to a "digital only" printing. Since
I was somewhat short on material for the regular NSS News, I offered
to include the material as part of one of our regular issues. So instead
of being a "Part 2" issue, this issue of the News includes both our
regular columns and the ACA material.

something is wrong. Stop and figure out
what it is or go home.
Gripping the rope with the off-rack
hand, pulling the rope around the hip, and
a bottom belay are a few of the methods
that can affect the friction from outside the
rack. Using them does not take advantage of
the variable friction feature of a rack. These,
and similar methods come at the cost of
efficiency. And, depending on the situation,
they may not always be an available option.
The most efficient way to take advantage
of a rack's options is to orient it perpendicu-
larly to the rappeller's body-looking at the
ends of the bars with the short leg away. This
makes it possible to easily move the rope to
adjust rope entry angles and drop or add bars
(see Figure 3). "J"- shaped rack frames are
available with either a straight or twisted (90°)
eye to accommodate different style harnesses
(Figure 5). Most caving harnesses are best
coupled with a twisted-eye rack.
"U" shaped racks only offer limited
variable friction. The bars can be spread and
squeezed but dropping bars can be danger-
ous. Because the rope is trapped in the "U",
dropping a bar can result in the loss of 11/2
bars of friction. This is a huge jump in the
amount of friction available and can easily
lead to problems.
Rappel racks are the most versatile
descending device ever created. They have

What happens
when it happens to you?
As an experienced caver, you know the
limits of your skills and abilities.
That confidence is what makes you
a good explorer.
AUGUST 2013
The very nature of caving requires it.
You feel safe in the belief that accidents
only happen to someone else.
But what happens when that someone
is on the trip you're leading?
Worse yet...
what happens if it's you?
Accidents are unpredictable.
They can impact your trip
at any time,
in any cave,
to any caver.
Do you know what to do?
Be part of the solution.

CAVING ACCIDENTS
"The line which separates the difficult from the dangerous is
sometimes very shadowy, but it is not an imaginary line. It is a true line,
without breadth. It is often easy to pass, and very hard to see. It is
sometimes passed unconsciously, and the consciousness that it has been

passed is felt too lately. If the doubtful line is passed consciously,
deliberately, one passes from doing that which is justifiable, to doing
that which is unjustifiable."

Introduction
This is the eighth annual report of the Safety and Techniques
Committee of the National Speleological Society on caving accidents in
North America. These reports, which have been arranged in
chronological order, are intended to be used as potential teaching or
training guides and are not attempts to indicate blame or find a
scapegoat.
More than half the accidents during 1974 involved falling or stumbling
from 10 to 180 feet. Fortunately, none of these were fatal. Two of the
accidents, both in New Mexico, were caused by inexperienced persons
relying on ladders or cables left in the cave by others. Many of the falls
were due simply to carelessness or inexperience.
Unlike natural fiber ropes, nylon ropes are not subject to rot;
however, they can be damaged by sunlight or any one of numerous
chemicals. One accident was due to hydrochloric acid on the caver's rope.
Another example of a fall caused by faulty (or possibly improperly used)
equipment occurred when a bolt pulled out as a man began his rappel.
These accidents could have been prevented had the cavers tested their
equipment before committing themselves to the rappel.
Hardhats with elastic chinstraps are notorious for not staying on the
victim's head during a fall. Hats came off in two of the falls, yet stayed on
during another. People who do vertical caving should avoid using elastic
chinstraps on their hard hats.
In addition to the injuries from falls, there were four cases where the
cavers were not injured but could not ascend the pits they had
descended. Four groups of inexperienced cavers became lost and had to
be rescued. In two of these incidents, the group's flashlights went dead.
The NSS has long recommended that each individual carry three
independent sources of light.
1974 was the worst year for cave diving accidents in U.S. history. At
least 23 people drowned in Florida's underwater caves. Only four of
these accidents, involving nine victims, are reported here. Multiple
deaths while scuba diving in caves are not uncommon. In one accident
four men drowned; a similar tragedy was reported in the 1967 American
Caving Accidents.
This report is incomplete because information was not available on
some accidents. For instance, seven accidents in the Garrison Chapel
karst area of Indiana were briefly mentioned in the NSS News, yet no
additional information was turned in to the NSS. It is not known how
complete a record of caving accidents in North America is provided by
this report. Those persons having information, either firsthand or
through newspaper stories, are requested to send the information to the
NSS office. We thank all those who did provide information and thus
made this report possible.

1973 Accidents
West Virginia, Organ Cave
Saturday, 8 December 1973
The second drop in the Humphrey's Section of Organ Cave is a 35-foot,
partially-free rappel near a small waterfall. The rappel was rigged with
Goldlon, which is a very stiff rope. Mike Dyas rappelled into the pit but
was held under the falls a few feet above the floor when a long loop in the
middle of the rope caught on the rough lip of the drop. The rope could not
be shaken free, so Greg Thomas climbed down a parallel ladder to
unhook the kink. Dyas had not been wearing his wet suit during the 10
minutes he was under the waterfall.
Undiscouraged, Dyas put on his wet suit and participated in further
exploration which involved two duckings in a 75-foot near-siphon. This
further sapped his endurance despite the exposure suit.
Returning to the waterfall, the only ascending gear in the party was a
prusik-like rig employing two Jumars. With some difficulty, two of the
cavers sucessfully ascended the pit. Dyas realized that this climbing
method would overtax his arms so instead he tried climbing the ladder
with a top belay. He did not have the strength to get over the sharp
overhang about two-thirds the way up and had to be lowered back to the
bottom. He again became soaked. Dyas attempted setting up a different
Jumar ascending rig with the slings available but was not able to get it
properly adjusted. On his final attempt to ascend, he became thoroughly
hung up and was forced to cut one sling loose and jump to the floor.
The two cavers who had climbed out then left to fetch Dyas's own
ascenders. Two and a half hours later they returned with the ascenders
and four additional cavers. Using his own ascenders, Dyas was able to
get out without help.
Analysis: Dyas had negotiated the Humphrey's Entrance previously on
quite a few demanding trips and had never experienced difficulty. The
basic problem this time was the fouled-up rappel and becoming soaked
several times in succession. These soakings and a run down feeling due
to a cold greatly reduced his endurance. For most of the time in the cave,
Dyas was wearing a wet suit and a wool sweater. This was a major factor
in averting advanced hypothermia during the wait for help to arrive.
To reduce bulk on survey trips, this group normally shares one or two
sets of vertical gear. Difficulty arose when the cavers tried using gear
which had been customized for another person.

New Mexico, Sandia Caverns
December 1974
Sandia Caverns is entered through a vertical borehole 24 inches in
diameter and 126 feet deep. The top 80 feet of the hole is protected with
a 20-inch-diameter steel casing. An alternate foot method of ascending is
used on a rope rigged in the borehole.
While John J. Corcoran was ascending the shaft, a foot sling came
untied from one of his ascenders. Because the shaft is so narrow,
Corcoran could not reach his foot to retie the ascender. The cavers on the
surface rigged the rope as a hauling line and pulled Corcoran up the
shaft. He was being pulled up quickly when his hard hat struck the
bottom of the casing causing the hard hat to slip down and cut his nose.
Analysis: "A more secure tie to the ascender, or a spare ascender or
prusik knot would have prevented the accident."
"Several persons have been pulled out of this shaft. Because the
borehole is so restricted and decreases in diameter part way up, any
problems caused by slack or improper rigging are magnified." (McLean)

"Tom, Tom, we're lost! We never can get out of this awful place! Oh,
why did we ever leave the others!"
She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom
was appalled with the idea that she might die or lose her reason. He sat
down by her and put his arms around her. She buried her face in his
bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing
regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom
begged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not.
Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat and made a
show of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the
cave. Then he took the kite line in his hand and went groping down one
of the passages on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick
with bodings of coming doom.

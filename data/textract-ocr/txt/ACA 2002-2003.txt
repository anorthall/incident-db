Common Caving Mistakes and Consequences
1. Primary light failed; didn't carry backup lights, or backup lights inadequate - stranded.
2. No map, no guide, and poor route-finding skills - lost.
3. Wore inadequate or inappropriate clothing for conditions - hypothermia.
4. Didn't bring extra clothing - hypothermia.
5. Moving but not paying attention - caver fall.
6. Free-climbing more than a body-length without belay - caver fall.
7. Traversing above drop without belay or safety line - caver fall.
8. Ignored rainy weather forecast; entered water cave - flood entrapment or drowning.
9. Careless movement in tight passage or crevice - stuck.
10. Entered bat cave or passage without precautions - histoplasmosis.
11. Solo caving and something went wrong - stranded.
12. Didn't tell anyone where you were going - delayed rescue by hours or days.
13. Vandalized cave formations, gates, or wildlife - criminal prosecution, fines, jail.
14. Didn't clear loose rocks from lip - struck by falling rock.
15. Climbing or descending rope hand-over-hand - lost grip and fell.
16. Climbing cable ladder without belay - fell off.
17. Lost control of rappel; no bottom belay or rappel safety - fell to the bottom.
18. Out of shape or unfamiliar with climbing system - stranded on rope.
19. Didn't know how to change from rappel to climb or from climb to rappel - stranded on rope.
20. Hair or clothing in rappel device; didn't know how to recover - stranded on rope.
21. Rappelling without wearing climbing system - stranded in pit or on rope.
22. Attempted pull-down trip without map or guide - stranded.
23. Sharing vertical gear; lost equipment passing it up or down the pit - stranded.
24. Didn't tie a knot in the end of the rope - rappelled off the end and fell.
25. Moving around lip of pit without being belayed or on rope - fell into pit.
26. Didn't check attachment of rappel device to harness - became detached from rappel device and fell.

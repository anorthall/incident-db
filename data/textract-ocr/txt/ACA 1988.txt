was that she could not use her gap reel (since she lacked a drop weight and
there were no nearby tie-offs).
"Given the coldness of the water, extremely limited to zero visibility, and
the fact that wetsuit gloves are necessary, it is debatable that a person under
stress could effectively use a gap reel without immediate recourse to an
easy line tie-off. An apparently necessary safety modification underscored
by this accident is the requirement to carry a drop weight with a quick
connect that can be handled even with wetsuit gloves. This can be used
under any conditions which might exist in the form of floor sediments to
permit the undertaking of a radial search with a minimum of lost time.

Note that in the incident write-ups I almost always do not mention rescuer's
names. These people are heroes and deserve recognition, but mentioning one
would require, in the name of fair-play, mentioning all. This is not the place for it.
The analyses may seem vague and inconclusive at times, but one must remember
that safety margins are different for different cavers. The main reason for this
publication is to show what can happen - how you deal with the possibilities is up
to you.

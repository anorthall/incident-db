CAVING ACCIDENTS
"The line which separates the difficult from the dangerous is sometimes very
shadowy, but it is not an imaginary line. It is a true line, without breadth. It is often
easy to pass, and very hard to see. It is sometimes passed unconsciously, and the
consciousness that it has been passed is felt too lately. If the doubtful line is passed

consciously, deliberately, one passes from doing that which is justifiable, to doing
that which is unjustifiable,"

Introduction
This report describes 23 caving accidents, all but three of which occurred on a
weekend. Roughly 40 percent of the accidents involved people doing vertical caving.
Both victims of the two fatal vertical accidents for 1972 were novices exploring
caves in Texas.
Cave diving has always been particularly dangerous. In one incident three men
drowned in a Florida cave. In another cave an unconscious man was saved after being
pulled from the water and given artificial respiration. There were undoubtedly other
cave diving accidents which were not brought to the attention of this committee. A

Several changes to the format of American Caving Accidents have been made
starting with this issue. The reports are listed chronologically instead of geograph-
ically. Sources of information have been given in more detail than in the past. This
should be beneficial to historians interested in particular caves or accidents. It may
also explain why the details or the analysis of some accidents are sketchy. The sum-
mary has been reorganized into two main groupings to show statistics about the
accidents and the people involved.

Summary
The large percentage of cave diving deaths involves young, inexperienced divers,
who venture into popular cave diving locations with their buddy who is equally in-
experienced. They both go beyond the point of their capabilities only to have an
accident which could have been prevented by good judgement. There were 79
diving deaths in the twelve-year period between 1960 and 1971.

Conclusion
Cave diving can be a very safe and enjoyable sport when it is approached in the
proper manner with the correct training and equipment and mature judgement. Cave
diving has a reputation for being a hazardous sport; however, the primary reason
for this reputation is because of press sensationalism and the tendency for many
persons to exaggerate the number of accidents to reporters and other writers.

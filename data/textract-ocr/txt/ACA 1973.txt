Introduction
The accidents during 1973 followed the same general trends as in previous years.
That is, roughly 40 percent of the accidents were in vertical caves. Most accidents
were relatively minor incidents in horizontal caves. As in the past, the typical cave
accident victim was a male, between 15 to 30 years of age, who was unaffiliated
with any organized caving group and had little or no caving experience. Almost
two-thirds of all accidents happened on either Saturday or Sunday.
In spite of the general trend of accidents following the patterns of earlier years,
there were several types of incidents which had not been reported previously in
American Caving Accidents. (1) Cavers contracted histoplasmosis in three
widely-separated caves in North America. (2) A man evidently was killed by
vampire bats in Mexico. (3) Almost all cavers are told of the dangers of caving
alone, yet surprisingly, prior to this issue of American Caving Accidents. there was
only one report of a solo caver being injured. The 1973 American Caving Accidents
has two examples, one of which was a drowning.
Incidents have been included if they occurred in a North American cave during
1973, and either involved an injury or a rescue effort by persons outside the caver's
party (even if there was no injury). The accident reports have been arranged in
chronological order. The sources for the accident information have been listed at
the end of each report. Hopefully, this will be useful to cave historians or others
interested in particular accidents.
Although four drownings in caves are reported here, this report covers only a
small fraction of the cave diving accidents which have taken place. David
Desautels of the National Association for Cave Diving states that in 1973 there
were fifteen cave drownings in Florida alone.
Readers familiar with earlier editions of American Caving Accidents will notice
that this issue has reports of many more accidents than in past years. Possible
reasons for this include the rapid growth of the caver population, less emphasis on
training and safety, and carelessness because of overconfidence. All of these are
undoubtably contributory factors for some accidents; however much of the large
rise in the number of accidents is probably due to an increased awareness of the
importance of reporting accidents. Cavers will learn of the wide range of safety
hazards which exist in caves only if they are reported. An unreported accident
serves as an object lesson only to those involved. In summary, the greater number
of accidents reported is probably due more to a willingness to report accidents
than to an actual rise in the number of accidents. We are indebted to the many
cavers who have contributed to this publication either by writing an accident
report or by sending information on an accident.
Hopefully, these reports will increase the cavers' consciousness of caving
hazards. Can we distinguish not only the dangers in caves but also the dangerous
caves? In rereading back issues of American Caving Accidents, it was noticed that
certain caves are mentioned several times. More specifically, Shaft Cave in Indiana
has had five accidents, Dead Deer Cave (Texas) had four, and Knox Cave (New
York), Cass Cave (West Virginia) and Organ Cave (West Virginia) have each had
three accidents. Nine other caves have each had two accidents. Many of these caves
are well-known to the general public and therefore are repeatedly the scenes of
rescues of novices.

such a fashion that the weight of the rock was supported by the heal of the caver's
boot. and a rock jutting up from the floor, so that there was no weight of
consequence on the caver's leg. However, he was left hanging out over the canyon
in a very strained position."
Brinegar's companions could not free him so left for help. Six members of the
Bloomington Indiana Grotto responded with considerable mechanical equipment.
"They tried to jack the rock up but could not: after a bit of examination and
discussion, they removed the collapsed pile one rock at a time. located the trapped
foot and the specific rock which was causing the hangup. and removed it with the
jack."
"Brinegar remained cool and calm throughout the event, even though he had
been holding himself in a strained position for some time. He assisted with moving
rocks and advising during the rescue operation. When he was freed and removed
from the trapped position, it was discovered that his boot was serving as a
keystone. and additional rock collapsed near the rescuers, but caused no problem.
From that point the removal of the caver was routine. and he was found to have
suffered no injuries other than pulled muscles." (Shofstall)
Analysis: Many caves contain unstable breakdown, and even experienced cavers
may not always recognize the instability. It is not known whether the victim took
an unusually foolhardy chance by exploring that particular breakdown area.

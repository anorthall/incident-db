engaging in underground "rock climbing" without first developing the
skills and adopting the techniques of a rock climber.
In this issue I have labeled reports as either "accident" or "incident" but
drawing the line between the two is difficult. My definition of accident in-
volves the following criteria:
1. An injury occurs, or
2. A caver gets into a situation where the
assistance of another is definitely needed.
Admittedly this results in the inclusion of some rather trivial
"accidents," but at least I don't have to make value judgements on such
things as extent of injury. Various types of incidents are included if I judge
them to be of educational value. Incidents are, after all, accidents that
didn't quite happen.
To avoid class discrimination I have tried not to label the cavers involved
with regard to affiliation or lack of it. I have also tried to name only vic-
tims.
The purpose of this publication is the education of cavers to the real
dangers of caving. Read the reports herein, keep them in mind, and
hopefully you will avoid similar bad situations or at least be better able to
handle them when they occur. Some of these reports are nightmarish, but
they did happen and could happen to you-remember it.
One final message regards the feeling by many cavers that by proclaiming
society to not be responsible for their welfare, that they are thus free to
pursue any irresponsible act that may occur to them. It should be obvious
to any rational person reading these reports that society will not relinquish
its feeling of responsibility toward the freeing of trapped victims or even
the recovery of a dead body. Remember, then, that even if you get yourself

National Speleological Society, Cave Avenue, Hunstville, Alabama 35810.
The NSS also has local chapters called grottos which affect cave safety
within their memberships by the common practice of holding sessions
demonstrating proper safety and techniques. Obviously, a new caver join-
ing a grotto benefits from his observation of safe techniques and practices
on caving trips with established members. Also, some grottos have publica-
tions which occasionally carry articles with material pertinent to safety.
In pursuing the editing of this issue of American Caving Accidents it has
become apparent that there are areas of caving safety which the NSS might
pursue with more energy. First, it seems that cavers who are not associated
with the organized caving scene (the NSS) tend to utilize some outrageously
outmoded techniques and equipment. This includes the lack of head pro-
tection, hand-over-hand descent and ascent, the flashlight as a primary
(sometimes only) light source, and lack of foresight in the form of extra
food and clothing for emergencies. It also seems that experience with
organized caving, whether from education or just peer pressure, creates
cavers who seem never to utilize the items listed above.
A number of accidents occur when a caver takes a fall while climbing
about in a cave. In rock climbing, a climber is inadequately protected if not
belayed when a fall could result in a serious injury (an "exposed" climb).
Rock climbers carry ropes and hardware and train themselves in the use of
these for climbing in exposed situations. So it should be in caving.

due to the pain. To get permission to administer pain-killing drugs word
was sent out to Lattka to radio for more assistance, also to include rock
climbing expertise.
At 4:30 a.m. (Sunday) a registered nurse arrived at the site of the victim
and administered morphine. Meanwhile a group of six rock climbers were
rigging the cave with ropes and pulleys. At 6 a.m. Demerol was ad-
ministered and the victim was moved through the crawlways to the main
portion of the Aragonite Room where he was tied on a wooden backboard.
He was then moved by Tyrolean traverse through, up and out of the Water-
fall Room, hoisted up the 60 foot pitch at the Waiting Room, along
another Tyrolean traverse through the crevice, removed from the
backboard to traverse a tight place, hauled up a steep slope and a 20 foot
pitch and again taken off the board to negotiate the tight entrance passage.
The victim exited the cave at about 2 p.m. Sunday, some 26 hours after
entering. His injuries were later diagnosed as a fractured right pelvis.

Accident: Vermont, Morris Cave
December 6, 1978
At 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday, December 6, Charles Cranian (43), a
teacher, entered a cave near Route 7 near Danby, Vermont in the company
of another teacher-and several boys from the school. Some distance into
the cave Cranian announced he "wasn't having fun" and started out. The
rest continued for a short distance and then started out also. They soon en-
countered Cranian, lying down and gasping for breath. They couldn't
move him and so left the cave for help.
The first rescuers on the scene were two locals who entered the cave at
4:30 p.m. and found the victim some 200 feet from the entrance, "lying on
his back screaming for help." The two got one in front and one behind and
began dragging the man toward the entrance. This proved too dificult in
the narrow, twisting cave and they went to the entrance and got a rope and
two members of the Manchester Rescue Squad. The four then returned to
the victim and used a rope arrangement to maneuver him through tight and
difficult places. Meanwhile the victim "kept moaning and yelling that he
was in shock." At 9:15 they emerged from the cave, with the victim semi-
conscious and talking weakly. At a hospital he was found to be unhurt.

Analysis: This appears to be a simple case of claustrophobia. I believe that
many people have a potential for this and that one result is the relative un-
popularity of caving as a sport. Certainly anyone with a dislike for closed
spaces should not be talked into caving or he could end up as a basket case
like this one.

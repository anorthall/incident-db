7) The Solo Caver The common concept is that solo caving is
exceedingly dangerous and foolhardy. Yet solo caving has always been
with us and there are very few instances of solo cavers in trouble.
Indeed, on the face of the evidence, cave diving is much more foolhardy.
AMERICAN CAVING ACCIDENTS - 1987
There are two types of solo cavers. One is the caver who operates
independently from companions in the same cave or area. His
We have again used the same classification scheme for incidents:
companions are aware of his "solo" efforts and will send help if
needed. The other is the true solo caver, who tells no one of his
intentions and is thus entirely on his own, truly solo.

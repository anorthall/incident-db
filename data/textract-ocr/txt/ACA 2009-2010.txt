The National Cave Rescue Commission
The National Cave Rescue Commission (NCRC) is a volunteer group developed to train cave rescue personnel throughout the United
States. It is part of the National Speleological Society, and located within the Department of the Administrative Vice-President.
The NCRC does not perform cave rescues. It organizes, develops, and provides training in cave rescue techniques, maintains lists of
individuals trained in cave rescue, and can help locate rescue resources in times of need. Most NCRC-trained cavers do participate in
rescues, but not as part of the NCRC. They work as members of their local rescue teams, civil defense units, or cave rescue groups.
The NCRC also works to:
Maintain good working relationships with other rescue-oriented individuals, organizations, government agencies, and
sources of specialized equipment and services (for example, the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center and the Center
for Mine Safety and Health Administration).
Maintain current files of potentially useful equipment (for example, underground communications equipment and cave-
oriented medical kits) and services that can be obtained through the above sources.
Acquire and maintain a limited supply of certain equipment, such as special rescue litters and vertical rescue gear, in
key locations throughout the country.
Increase the number and proficiency of cave rescuers across the United States by sponsoring training sessions and
seminars, and by encouraging other caving, rescue, and EMS organizations to sponsor such educational programs.
Encourage international cooperation by developing contacts with cave rescuers and rescue agencies in other countries,
by pre-planning with these groups where US involvement is anticipated, and by inviting participation of cave rescuers
from other countries in NCRC seminars.
Organization
The NCRC is led by a Board of Regional Coordinators that includes a National Coordinator, Training Coordinator, Medical
Coordinator, and Diving Coordinator (each of whom coordinates resources and activities at a national level), and Regional
Coordinators for each of ten regions in the United States and its territories. Board members are nominated by cavers and cave rescue
personnel, and are appointed by the NSS Board of Governors. The NCRC depends on many volunteers without official positions
whose special knowledge, talents, or contacts make the network more effective.
Training
The NCRC sponsors a week-long Cave Rescue Operations and Management Seminar each year that is held in various locations
around the United States. The seminar serves as a "boot camp" of cave rescue and provides three levels of training. Cave rescue is
constantly evolving, and the most up-to-date techniques are presented each year. In addition to the annual national week-long seminar,
the NCRC regions sponsor regional week-long seminars, regional modular seminars (taught over a series of weekends), courses in
small-group and self-rescue techniques, and weekend cave rescue orientation courses.
NCRC seminars consist of extensive classroom and field work designed to maximize the learning experience. The seminars include
lectures, demonstrations, and field exercises on underground environments, vertical rescue, mechanical advantage systems, extrication
techniques, basic medical principles, communications, and the management of cave rescue operations. Emphasis is placed on practical
skills and techniques, with realistic exercises in a variety of cave environments.
The seminars provide basic and advanced material for students, who typically include cavers, emergency services personnel, and
emergency managers. During the eight days of a seminar, students receive about 100 hours of instruction, and are on the move from
early morning well into the evening. The NCRC uses and teaches the Incident Command System (ICS) used by fire departments,
rescue squads, and other emergency agencies and services.
Course Listings and Contact Information
Information on NCRC operation, activities, and training, including contact information for NCRC Coordinators, is published each
year in the NSS Members Manual, and is also available on the NCRC website at www.ncrc.info. Upcoming seminars are announced
on the web site and in the NSS News.

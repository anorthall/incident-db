However, some of the falls in 2007 and 2008 were due to very
poor decisions. A spelunker fell while hand-over-handing down
a rope in Turtle Graveyard Cave when his dry-rotted rope broke.
Other incidents occurred when the person fell while holding a
flashlight in their hand, contributing to that person being unable
to react adequately to the situation.
Further poor decisions including not wearing helmets increased

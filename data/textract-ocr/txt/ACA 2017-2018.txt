Editor's Note
To report, or not to report, that is the question. At
least, that's the question cavers ask me all the time.
When cavers learn that I am the editor of American
Caving Accidents, a typical response is, "Oh, you collect ac-
cident reports? Did you ever hear about my incident in XYZ
Cave?" To which my response is usually, "No. Did you sub-
mit a report to ACA?"
As the editor of American Caving Accidents (ACA)
for the past nine years, I have struggled to understand why
SO many cavers are happy to tell me their accident stories in
person at the NSS Convention or at a cave-rescue seminar,
but getting them to submit a report to ACA is more difficult
than opening a tweaked D-ring. From the resulting conver-
sations, I believe that the most common reasons why cavers
do not submit incident reports are: they aren't sure if their
incident would "qualify", they are intimidated to write
a report for publication or do not have the time, they are
embarrassed or concerned about bad publicity for a caver,
cave, or landowner; or they thought somebody else would

submit the report. In an effort to encourage more reporting
of incidents, I will address those concerns here.

needed for an interesting and informative report. From that
information, the ACA committee then writes the report that
will appear in print. The reporting party is usually contact-
ed to clarify information and fact check the ACA summary.
Does it still sound like too much work? ACA also
accepts reports by e-mail or phone interviews. You can con-
tact the editor by email, aca@caves.org, or find my personal
contact information in the NSS Members Manual.
I don't want to be embarrassed or embarrass anyone else.
This is understandable. The good news is, ACA will honor
anonymity requests. As you read this issue, you will see
numerous reports with no caver names mentioned. Cave
names can be withheld as well, which is why some loca-
tions are listed as "unspecified cave." It is never the inten-
tion of ACA to embarrass anyone. I hope that as you read

Berome Moore Cave, Missouri
caver fall, injury, no aid
Laura Belarbi led a team of six cavers into Berome
Moore Cave on a stream monitoring trip. As the trip leader,
Belarbi had discussed proper gear, including boots, with
her group. One woman showed up wearing tennis shoes
and insisted that she had caved in tennis shoes before and
would be fine.
At one point during the trip, another experienced
caver was in the lead. When he reached a spot that required
stepping across a gap with the stream 6 feet below, he made
the move easily. When the woman in tennis shoes attempt-
ed to cross this gap, her foot slid upon landing and she fell
across the boulder onto her stomach, injuring her wrist in
the process. She told the group she would be fine to con-
tinue. Belarbi notes, "She was the note-taker for our stream
monitoring for the next 2 1/2 hours and didn't complain at
all."
Immediately after the trip, the injured woman went
to an urgent care facility and was diagnosed with a broken
wrist. She was placed in a cast that she wore for the next six
weeks.

1. John Dunham, Incident Report, 28 July 2017.
Comments: The submitted Incident Report includ-
ed its own analysis: this rescue could have been avoided
altogether. It is commonly noted in American Caving Acci-
dents that cable ladders should be accompanied with a belay.
Certainly, had that been the case here, the patient's injuries
would have been less severe or non-existent. This climb will
be rigged with a belay line on future trips. The rescue could
have been expedited had rope and pulleys been on hand
at the cave entrance. This would have allowed rigging of a
successful haul system one to two hours sooner. The group
involved intends to carry a small haul system in the future."

The group explored several sections of the cave.
When they decided it was time to head out of the cave, the
club broke into two groups. The club president led the faster
group of students while the trip leader stayed behind with
the slower-moving students. At some point, a 19-year-old
freshman left the slower group to catch up with the faster
group, but he missed a critical turn toward the entrance.
Once he realized his mistake, he turned around and headed
toward the entrance.
The two groups exited the cave and locked the cave
gate behind them. The club president did a head count in
the parking area, counting 11 people. Believing this was the
number they started with, the group got into three vehicles.
Some students rode home in different vehicles than they
arrived in. The trip leader later noted that he arrived with

equipment problem, aid, no injury
On 1 December, a group of cavers from Indiana
drove to Alabama for three days of camping and caving.
After visiting one popular pit, they drove to Valhalla Cave.
They had received a permit from the Southeastern Cave
Conservancy, Inc. for camping and caving on the property.
They arrived at the campsite after dark and found another
vehicle already parked there. The vehicle did not show any
evidence it belonged to a caver, such as NSS or bat stickers,
SO the cavers assumed it belonged to a hunter who would
be returning at any time.
The next morning the vehicle was still there. The
cavers took their time preparing and eating breakfast and
organizing their gear. The first cavers arrived at the en-
trance pit at 11:30 a.m. and were surprised to see two ropes

concludes his report, "We decided the best course of action
was to kick the tree into the pit, as it was inevitable that it
was going in. A few kicks and the tree fell in and wedged
itself into the main part of the pit, giving us a new obstacle
to work around on the next trip."

Chad McCain, Alex Litsch, and Cody Brooks
planned a day of surveying and bolt climbing in Pentagon
Pit. They rigged the entrance pit the way they had on pre-
vious trips, by first tying to a large oak tree located 30 feet
away from the pit. At the lip of the pit stood an 8-inch-diam-
eter hickory tree. It had died earlier that year but still had
its bark and looked solid. They girth-hitched two Spectra
slings about 5 feet above the lip of the pit on the hickory
tree. A butterfly knot in the mainline was clipped into the
slings. This gave them an approach line to the pit with a rig
point high enough that they could rappel or ascend right
past the lip. Slack remained in the mainline between the
two trees to make transitioning from the climbing rope to
the traverse line easier.
At the end of the trip, McCain ascended first. Thirty
feet up, he heard a loud pop, followed by movement in the
rope. He then dropped about 6 feet and portions of a tree
top came crashing down the pit. McCain continued to climb
slowly. When he was within 20 feet of the top, he could see

AMERICAN CAVING ACCIDENTS - 1990
This publication is only as good as the reports sent. It is probably fair to say that all the facts are never received and that
inaccuracies may be found in these pages. Furthermore, you may find yourself in disagreement with the comments made
regarding a particular incident. There is often no clear conclusion that can be drawn. I offer my opinions and those of others
as a guideline; draw your own conclusions if you like. There is no single set of rules that can define "safe caving" for every
caver. But read on--if you read this publication, your safety awareness will surely increase.
Send any information on any incident to:

PEACOCK SPRINGS, FL
November 4
AAd - Drowning
On Sunday, November 4, Darden Davis (46) entered the
Olsen Sink Entrance to the Peacock Springs Cave System in
Suwannee County in north Florida. Davis was an experienced
and certified cave diver, and was equipped with dual-manifolded
104 cubic-foot doubles and an 80-cubic-foot stage bottle. He
proceeded into the upstream tunnel, with which he was
reportedly familiar, on a legal, solo dive.
His body was found 150 feet from Olsen Sink. The 80 was
empty, but there was 1200 psi in the 104's. The valve
regulator (SPG) had been turned off. When the equipment was
tested later, it was found that there was a second stage free-flow
malfunction. This may be the reason it had been turned off.
"Davis was presumably then trying to exit and bumped the
other valve handle to the backup regulator causing it to shut off
or he might have only cranked it open a bit initially and as tank
pressure dropped, it no longer was able to allow the backup
regulator to function.
It is hypothesized that, under the stress of breathing from a
poorly performing backup regulator, the deceased may have
forgotten about having turned the primary regulator off (which
would cause his SPG to read zero). He might have concluded
a dead SPG and a hard-drawing regulator meant that his doubles
were nearly dry, and thus have resorted to his stage bottle."
On the stage bottle a single hose regulator with two second
stages was attached, one was found to be sticking. As the
deceased tried to exit the cave system in an emergency, there
could have been air lost from the second stage not being used.
NOTICE:
In any case, it was his last dive. The Florida State Parks have
since been closed to solo diving.

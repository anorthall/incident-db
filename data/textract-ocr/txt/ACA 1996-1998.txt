On Saturday, June 27, Michael Hostetler (24) drowned
while crossing the Greenbrier River below the mouth of
Blinky
Second Creek after a caving trip in Windy Mouth Cave. It is
time
believed that he stepped off a ledge and could not shed his
pack and clothing before he sank into a deep pool.

Comments: When crossing deep water, it is wise to loosen
your pack or other equipment SO that you can quickly jettison
for
it if you fall in or lose your footing. Wet equipment can drag
hipping
you down or impede your ability to swim to safety.

The National Cave Rescue Commission
The National Cave Rescue Commission (NCRC) is a volunteer group developed to train cave rescue personnel throughout the
United States. It is part of the NSS, and is a unit Education Division within the Department of the Administrative Vice-President. The
NCRC does not perform cave rescues. It organizes, develops, and provides training in cave rescue techniques; maintains lists of cave
rescue trained persons; and can help locate rescue resources in times of need. Most NCRC-trained cavers do participate in rescues, but
not as part of the NCRC. They work as members of their local rescue squads, civil defense units, or cave rescue groups. The NCRC
also works to:
Maintain good working relationships with other rescue-oriented individuals, organizations, government agencies, and
sources of specialized equipment and services (e.g., the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center and Center for Mine Safety
and Health Administration).
Maintain current files of possibly useful equipment (including, but not limited to, underground communications
equipment, cave oriented medical kits, etc.) or services which can be obtained through the above sources.
Develop and maintain a limited supply of certain equipment such as special rescue litters and vertical rescue gear in key
locations throughout the country.
Increase the number and proficiency of cave rescuers across the U.S., by sponsoring training sessions and seminars, and
by encouraging other caving, rescue, or EMS organizations to sponsor such educational programs.
Encourage international cooperation by developing contacts with cave rescuers and rescue agencies in other countries, by
preplanning with these groups where U.S. involvement is anticipated, and by inviting participation of cave rescuers from
other countries in NCRC seminars.
Organization
The NCRC is led by a Board of Regional Coordinators. The Board includes a National Coordinator, Training Officer, Medical
Officer, and Diving Officer (each of whom coordinates resources and activities at a national level), and Regional Coordinators for
each of ten regions in the United States and its territories. Board members are nominated by cavers and cave rescue personnel, and
must be approved by the NSS Board of Governors. The NCRC depends on many volunteers with no official position whose special
knowledge, talents, or contacts make the network more effective.
Training
The NCRC sponsors a weeklong Cave Rescue Operations and Management Seminar each year which is held in various locations
around the U.S. The seminar serves as a "boot camp" of cave rescue and involves three levels of training. Cave rescue is constantly
evolving, and the most up-to-date techniques are presented each year. In addition to the annual national weeklong seminar, the NCRC
regions sponsors regional weeklong seminars, regional modular seminars (taught over a series of weekends), courses in small-group
and self-rescue techniques, and weekend cave rescue orientation courses.
NCRC seminars consist of extensive classroom and field work designed to maximize the learning experience. The cave rescue
programs provide studies in underground environments, vertical rescue, pulley systems, extrication techniques, basic medical
principles, communications, and management of cave rescue operations. Emphasis is placed on practical skills and techniques, with
realistic exercises in a variety of cave environments. The seminar provides basic and advanced material for students who typically
include cavers, emergency services personnel, and emergency managers. During the eight days of the seminar, students receive about
100 hours of instruction, and are "on the move" from early morning well into the evening. The NCRC uses and teaches the Incident
Command System (ICS) used by fire departments, rescue squads, and other emergency agencies and services.

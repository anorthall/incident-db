INTRODUCTION
This reprint of the 1967 to 1970 issues of American Caving Accidents is being
produced in order to make more available the lessons learned during that period
about safety in cave exploration. It is likely that many readers of this reprint are
not themselves 'cavers'. but rather are experienced in the mountains or other
environments. They will undoubtedly recognize analogous situations and, I regret
to say, find the often tragic results not entirely unexpected. But if we are to avoid
learning only by our own mistakes, and to learn something from the experiences of
others. accident reports and analyses are essential. These were prepared in that
spirit.
Published separately. each report had its own Introduction and Summary.
These are consolidated in this reprint; probably the best Introduction is a selection
from the original publications:
AMERICAN CAVING ACCIDENTS - 1967
"A primary and continuing function of the Safety Committee shall be to
assemble and disseminate information on caving accidents in the United States.
The project is planned along the lines of the American Alpine Club's excellent
report Accidents in American Mountaineering wherein careful descriptions are
given of each accident, followed by an analysis as to probable cause and possible
prevention of similar occurrences. (NSS NEWS, April 1958).
"That stated goal of over ten years ago has been reached with this first
publication of American Caving Accidents - 1967. And, as projected in 1958, we
have unabashedly imitated the style and format used by the American Alpine
Club. We shall hope that they will accept this as the compliment it is meant to be.
"The purpose of publishing accounts of accidents is, of course, to contribute
to the prevention of accidents. By learning more about the situations that lead to
accidents, it is possible to identify weaknesses in techniques, equipment and
organization, to which attention should be given. Awareness of dangers goes a long
way towards surmounting them.
"Accounts of many of the accidents reported here have appeared elsewhere,
but it serves a useful purpose to gather them together in a continually available
publication. Reports of most major caving accidents appear in the NSS NEWS.
Reporting only major accidents, however, gives a distorted picture of the hazards
of caving; there are many more minor accidents and incidents, and many of these
are very instructive. Eventually, some line will have to be drawn between the trivial
and the significant; in this first report, every accident that someone thought
important enough to bring to the attention of the Safety Committee has been
reported. We fully realize that the reporting of caving accidents has been very
irregular and that we have probably received reports on only a fraction of the
less-major accidents that have occurred. We hope that having these compilations
appear regularly will encourage complete and accurate records of caving
accidents.
"Accident locations are identified by State and cave name. The states are
arranged geographically, approximately by caving areas from East to West.

ledge about 5 feet higher and attempted to "retable." The upper ledge. a slab
about 5x2x1 feet, came free and fell "without a sound;" Foote found himself
standing on the floor of the room with the slab at his feet. Foote was uninjured
except for scratches on his chin and throat, and a bruise on his chest.
The party was unable to move the rock in order to recover two packs upon which
it had fallen.
Source: Wayne Foote
Analysis: (Foote) The writer used to hear a saying that a rock falls in a cave once
every 10,000 years. Whether this is myth or fact, it is certainly true that in the
comparatively short time a caver is under any particular rock it is unlikely to fall.
On the other hand. a rock that would not fall by itself for another hundred years
might fall on a caver if he put his weight on it. Therefore, potential breakdown in

farther or climb out. Although he was not wedged in the aperture, companions
found him too heavy to lift manually.

contacted the State Police for assistance at about 1:20 p.m. Meanwhile, Baker

Analysis: The problem was not immediately critical because Crim was not injured.

New York, Ellenville Ice Caves: On 11 April, six boys, accompanied by the mother
of two of them, visited the Ice Caves Mountain tourist attraction. After touring the
area by the public paths during the morning, three of the boys, Ted Wunderlich,
Jr. (17). Michael Wunderlich (9) and John Boudion (16) went off to explore on their
own.
Going to the end of the "crystal chasm". they left the fenced area and, ignoring
warning signs, walked to a cave-like entrance. Ted walked in first, shining a
flashlight. Police subsequently said that when the boys were about 25 feet into the
narrow cave, Michael darted in front of his brother and stepped off a ledge into
total blackness. The boy plunged 40 feet down a two-to-three foot opening and
landed in an underground stream. His body was recovered later that day.

Pennsylvania, Big Ridge Cave: On 25 May Tom O'Holleran (18), Orville Ormsby
(24), and Del Myers (20) descended into Big Ridge Cave by rappel and proceeded
toward the squeeze in the stream passage. Enroute, one must descend a slopping
fissure.
While climbing down the fissure, O'Holleran slipped and slid 8 feet to the
bottom, landing on his feet. In the process he struck his knee painfully against the
wall. The party then left the cave. It was subsequently discovered that O'Holleran's
knee was not just bruised. but deeply cut. Eight stitches were required to close the
wound. and an artery had been nearly cut.
Source: Del Myers (Nittany Grotto News, Jan-Feb 1970).
Analysis: O'Holleran, who had only started caving a few months previously, was
apparently unaccustomed to scrambling on muddy and insecure slopes. Only more
care in moving could have prevented the accident. He was fortunate in an artery
not being severed, as a more elaborate rescue probably then would have been
necessary.

NSS POLICY
FOR CAVE CONSERVATION
The National Speleological Society believes: That caves have unique scientific,
recreational, and scenic values: That these values are endangered by both
carelessness and intentional vandalism; That these values once gone, cannot be
recovered: and that the responsibility for protecting caves must be assumed by
those who study and enjoy them.
Accordingly, the intention of the Society is to work for the preservation of caves
with a realistic policy supported by effective programs for: the encouragement of
self-discipline among cavers; education and research concerning the causes and
prevention of cave damage; and special projects, including co-operation with other
groups similarly dedicated to the conservation of natural areas. Specifically:
All contents of a cave-formations, life, and loose deposits-are significant for
its enjoyment and interpretation. Therefore, caving parties should leave a cave as
they find it. They should provide means for the removal of waste; limit marking to
a few. small and removable signs as are needed for surveys; and, especially,
exercise extreme care not to accidentally break or soil formations, disturb life
forms or unnecessarily increase the number of disfiguring paths through an area.
Scientific collection is professional, selective and minimal. The collecting of
mineral or biological material for display purposes, including previously broken or
dead specimens. is never justified, as it encourages others to collect and destroys
the interest of the cave.
The Society encourages projects such as: establishing cave preserves; placing
entrance gates where appropriate; opposing the sale of speleothems; supporting
effective protective measures; cleaning and restoring over-used caves; cooperating
with private cave owners by providing knowledge about their cave and assisting
them in protecting their cave and property from damage during cave visits, and
encouraging commercial cave owners to make use of their opportunity to aid the
public in understanding caves and the importance of their conservation.
Where there is reason to believe that publication of cave locations will lead to
vandalism before adequate protection can be established, the Society will oppose
such publication.
It is the duty of every Society member to take personal responsibility for
spreading a consciousness of the cave conservation problem to each potential user
of caves. Without this, the beauty and value of our caves will not long remain with
us.

with material pertinent to safety.
The primary purpose of this publication is to allow cavers to educate themselves
on the real hazards of caving through reading accounts of real accidents and
incidents. Analyses are also offered but are not meant to be an absolute answer -
sometimes they are just speculation based on what facts are known. In any case,

Usually the message an accident presents is clear. The difficulty, safety-wise,

ACCIDENT: Missouri, Jam-up Cave

In the spring of 1979 there was an accident in Jam-up Cave on the Jack's Fork
River in Missouri. The injured man was at the bottom of a 30 foot shaft. He was
placed in a Stokes litter and a winch cable was attached. A rescuer was also

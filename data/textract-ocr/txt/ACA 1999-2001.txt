Lightning Safety for Cavers
John Gookin
Numerous cavers have been shocked by lightning. The
serious injuries have been near cave entrances, especially
when metal cables, cable ladders, and wires were being used.
Cavers walking on the surface, to and from caves, are
generally at greater lightning risk than they are while caving.
In general, it is much safer to be well inside a cave than on the
surface during an electrical storm. But some cave entrance
areas appear to be even more dangerous than other places on
the surface.
One proviso: Non-cavers often call small overhangs
"caves." Small overhangs are especially dangerous. Lightning
tends to flash over surfaces, and it easily jumps the gaps of
these small pseudo-caves, especially when rain water is
running. Humans offer better paths for conducting electricity
across those gaps. Be sure to tell non-cavers that cave
entrances are dangerous during electrical storms, SO they will
get the message that these "caves" are poor places to be in a
thunderstorm. Real cavers who are underground probably

Discussing theories of why some caves are more lightning
prone than others is an academic exercise that may eventually
help us predict relative risks in certain caves. But it is a fact
that some caves are more lightning-prone than others. When
the locals tell us that certain caves are lightning-prone, we
should be careful around these entrances by minimizing our
time of exposure during storms.

These COWS made three fatal mistakes: 1) They were in an open area during a storm, exposing themselves to a direct strike. 2) They were near a long
conductor, which probably channeled high voltage down from a hillside strike. 3) They naturally had their legs spread far apart (about as far apart as a
person lying down), providing significantly more voltage to one leg than the others, which drove ground current in one leg and out the others.

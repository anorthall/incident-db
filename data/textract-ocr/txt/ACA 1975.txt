Introduction
This is the ninth annual report of the Safety and Techniques
Committee of the National Speleological Society on caving accidents in
North America. These reports, which have been arranged in
chronological order, are intended to be used as potential teaching or
training guides and are not attempts to indicate blame or find a
In Memoriam
scapegoat.
Regretfully, 1975 was distinguished by an unusually large number of
fatal accidents. Five cave diving accidents are mentioned here, but as in
LEWIS HOLTZENDORFF, NSS 14831
previous editions of American Caving Accidents, this is believed to be

caves. There were nine nondiving caving deaths in 1975, including three
novices who drowned while exploring caves under flood conditions.
Three outstanding cavers who died in 1975 doing what they loved.
Novices were not always the victims in other fatal accidents; two men
were crushed to death in separate accidents at the mouths of caves. One
of these men was on his first cave trip, but the other had a reputation as
an outstanding, hard-pushing caver. Of the three fatal accidents
involving vertical caves, one boy was a novice, but another was a skilled
caver with over 15 years of vertical experience. Many people have long
thought that beginning cavers are most likely to be involved in an
accident. This is true if one looks at the overall statistics; however, one
cannot maintain, as some have, that only the novice becomes injured
while caving.
Allan Haarr furnished copies of most of the reports which were
previously printed in grotto newsletters. Don Davison, Jr. offered
constructive comments about the analysis of many of the accidents. As in
previous editions of American Caving Accidents, this report was made
possible only because many NSS members reported the accidents so that
cavers might learn from the mistakes of others.

Indiana, Buckner Cave
Sunday, 27 October 1974
R. J. Blenz received word Monday morning that a group of
Indianapolis boys were believed to be lost in Buckner Cave. Blenz and
other cavers entered the cave about 8 a.m. David Archer, Steve Ballard,
Steve Beatty, Rick Bell, Pete Whitaker and Gary Moos, all between 18
and 21 years old, were found safe an hour later. The group had been in
the cave about 24 hours. Moos had the flu and was suffering nausea and
severe fatigue, but eventually he made it out under his own power by
11 a.m.
Analysis: When found the group had several dim but serviceable
flashlights and a little food. They had tried to find their way out but had

been to the cave a few weeks before but could not remember the route

Kentucky, Cool Spring Cave
January 1975
Three inexperienced cavers, David Philips (22), Mark Philips (18), and
Mark Winstead (19), went caving when it was raining. Mark Philips'
flashlight gave out and Winstead dropped his into the water. They then
tried to leave the cave using their only remaining flashlight. About 300
feet from the entrance they found the exit blocked by rising floodwater.
The water rose 18 feet in less than 2 hours, but the three novices were
rescued at 3:45 a.m. by cavers from Cadiz, Kentucky.
Analysis: Inexperience allowed the group to enter the cave during bad
weather and with inadequate light sources. Had the last light failed,

Summary
This issue of American Caving Accidents contains the reports of 42
incidents involving 86 persons.
The summary tables have been divided into two parts. The first part
gives statistics on the type of cave accidents. For each accident report
there is one entry under situation, month, and day of the week.
Classification of accidents by cause and contributory cause is open to a
lot of subjective interpretation of the individual reports since often an
accident occurred only after a combination of events had taken place.
The second part of the summary tables deals with the accident
victims. In each category, there is one entry for each victim.
Suggestions for improvement or modification of the summary or any
part of this report are welcome and should be addressed to the National
Speleological Society, Safety and Techniques Committee, Cave Avenue,

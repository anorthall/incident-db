24 February 2019
Tumbling Rock Cave, Alabama
difficulty on rope, no injury, no aid
After spending a few hours in Tumbling Rock Cave, a
female caver in her early 30s began descending a rope at
the top of the Inner Sanctum room. Ten feet from the top is
a rebelay. The caver expressed concern to the group about
crossing the rebelay. She had crossed rebelays before but
had not practiced them recently. Experienced cavers in the
group decided to descend last SO that they would be there
to coach her through the process.
The caver rappelled down the top section of rope,
clipped her short cowstail into the anchor, derigged her
rack, and then rerigged her rack below the anchor into the
bottom rope. The caver then found that she was unable to
stand up in the rebelay loop and therefore could not un-
weight and unclip her short cowstail. Although she was
wearing ascending gear, she was also unable to use an as-

Three cavers were shuttling scientific equipment down
a boulder-strewn slope into a glacier cave. The equipment
was packed in large Pelican cases, and the cavers were
spread out down the slope, methodically passing the cases
down the slope to the next person, and then advancing to
the front of the line to continue. At one point, Mark Dickey
(37) had just handed off the last case and was maneuvering
around the other two cavers to advance to the front of the
line. As he began to pass, he felt the rocks below him start
to shift. He stopped moving and told the others to traverse
sideways across the slope. Once they were clear, Dickey
also tried to move across the slope, but a substantial section
of the boulder field below and around him began moving
downhill. The shifting rocks caused him to lose his footing
and roll a short distance, but he managed to land on his feet.
One very large boulder, the size of a small car, narrowly
missed hitting him.
Dickey exited the cave to recover for a few hours but
was then able to resume normal activities. He reports that
he was sore and bruised the next day but otherwise unhurt.

Juan Gerardo Cruces (25) was reported missing on

and they searched the cave more thoroughly. Cruces body

150-foot fall from the surface. The victim had a permit to
hike to the cave, but there is no indication he had intended

was not able to climb down to the dog, SO he dropped all
of his hiking snacks into the cave for the dog. He then went
home and asked for help on his nature website, Florida-

fatality, fell into cave
When a 71-year-old man had not been seen for a few
days, a friend became worried and called the police. At first,
nothing at the man's home in Hilo looked amiss. Police then
noticed a lawnmower and weed eater in the yard, and upon
investigation, they found that the man had fallen through a
small hole in the ground while trimming bushes. That hole
opened to a 20-foot drop into a lava tube. Police speculate
that the hole was hidden under dirt and vegetation and the
man did not know it was there.

Comments: Care must be taken to prevent tragic ac-
cidents such as this when living, working, or traveling
through cave and karst terrain. In many cave areas, and
often in lava tube areas, there is only a thin overburden be-
tween the surface and any caves below, and holes in the

calf rescued from sinkhole
A group of cavers was preparing for a survey trip when
a neighboring farmer knocked at their door, asking to bor-
row a rope. One of the farmer's calves was stuck in a sink-
hole. Cavers Chris Bauer, Adam Mathis, Angela Pullano,
and Laura Demarest offered to help.
The calf was badly wedged about 10 to 12 feet down in
a funnel-shaped sinkhole about three feet in diameter. The
calf had likely been there overnight.
Bauer used a reptile hook to position webbing under
the calf's chest and around a leg. Then, using a 3:1 mechani-
cal advantage haul system anchored to a tractor, the team
extricated the calf from the sinkhole. In her report, Demar-
est says, "The calf was stiff and exhausted but took a long
stretch, got to its feet with assistance and tottered over to
its anxious mother to nurse. About 10 minutes later it was
moving with no sign of injury - a success!"

2020 Caving Accidents and Incidents
17 January 2020
Heart of Gould Cave, Tennessee
rockfall, injury and aid
In January 2020, a group of cavers was exploring Heart
of Gould Cave, rigging and exploring virgin pits as well
as performing lead climbs. After checking several pits and
promising leads, Jim Fox (50) was making his way back
down a number of pitches. He rappelled a short rope that
went over a boulder and ended at the top of a narrow ledge
that straddled two pits, one of those pits being 107 feet deep.
As he rappelled past the boulder, he saw that the boulder
was barely wedged in place and was starting to move to-
ward him. When he landed on the ledge, rocks began to fall.
The first rocks hit him in the face, cutting his nose badly.
The next rocks struck him in the shoulder, knocking him
down. More rocks hit his back, damaging a lung, which
caused him to cough up blood for a week. Finally, the big
boulder fell, fracturing Fox's femur.
While some members of Fox's group attended to his in-
juries, one caver went for help, calling 911 around 6:00 p.m.
The responding rescuers faced several challenges, includ-
ing packaging Fox into a litter on the narrow ledge strad-
dling two pits, blasting cave passages to widen them for
the litter, and negotiating several tight spots and vertical
obstacles. Fox reached the surface at about 3:00 a.m. and
was transported by ATV to a waiting ambulance.
This was an extremely technical rescue performed by
members of the Sparta-White County Rescue Squad, the
Chattanooga-Hamilton County Rescue Service Cave-Cliff
Team, the Knoxville Volunteer Emergency Rescue Squad,
and the Huntsville Cave Rescue Unit, among others.

3. Jim Fox, e-mail communication, 26 March 2020.
Comments: This cave rescue presented significant chal-
lenges and was likely successful due only to the high level
of skill and training of the responders as well as the sheer
toughness of the patient. Femur fractures are high-risk in-
juries that require skilled medical care and evacuation. This
rescue required medical care, rigging, passage modifica-
tion, and more, all by rescuers that can travel up and down
pits on their own. Cave rescue is a highly technical skill that
requires a lot of training to maintain competence. The suc-
cess of this rescue speaks highly to the teams' commitment
to readiness.

Weybridge Cave, Vermont
difficulty on rope, no injury, no aid
On 25 January around noon, eight cavers chipped the
ice out of the entrance to Weybridge Cave in Vermont as
part of a Boston Grotto trip. The group consisted of three
experienced cavers plus five people who were relatively
new to caving. Weybridge Cave is one of the few northeast
caves open in the winter; it features a relatively tight verti-
cal entrance consisting of two drops measuring 18 feet and
40 feet. Snowmelt had created a small but cold waterfall in
the entrance drops.
After the group explored the cave, the trip leader posi-
tioned the experienced cavers at the top and bottom of the
entrance pitches with the newer cavers in between them.

exhaustion, aid, no injury
After a day of ridgewalking with other cavers, a 31-year-
old woman began showing signs of dehydration and pos-
sible heat exhaustion. The day was warm with relative hu-
midity near 95%. When the cavers reached their vehicles,
the woman drank some water and immediately began vom-
iting. Bouts of vomiting continued for almost 30 minutes,
and her condition progressed to severe headaches, confu-
sion, and eventually difficulty maintaining consciousness.
The cavers began driving until they had cell phone re-
ception and called 911. They arranged to meet emergency
personnel in the parking lot of a Dollar General store. While
they waited, the cavers applied ice bags to the woman's
body. After being transported to an emergency room, she
received fluids through an IV and was discharged four
hours later.

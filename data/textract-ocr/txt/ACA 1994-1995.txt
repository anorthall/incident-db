Caving Risk Assessment Grid
John Gookin
I use this caving risk assessment grid in teaching caving. It helps me talk to other instructors about what sorts of caves, or
passages, are appropriate for different levels of students. It especially helps me be proactive about letting students go into a passage or
new cave without instructor supervision. I realize that my peers in the NSS use informal mentors more than formal instructors, but the
same principles apply. I would appreciate any comments or suggestions that might help make the grid more useful.

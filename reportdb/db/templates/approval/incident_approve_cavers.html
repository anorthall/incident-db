    Please review the incident report and add any cavers that were injured to the list below.

  <p>
    Only cavers that were <em>injured</em> should be added - not those who were present but uninjured. If a specific detail of
    a caver is not known, such as their age, gender, or last name, then you may leave that field blank.

      The AI may have automatically populated the names and ages of injured cavers. Injuries to each caver will need to be added

      cavers who were not injured.</mark>

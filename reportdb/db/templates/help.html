  <p class="lead">This page provides guidance on editing incidents.</p>

  <h2 class="subtitle underline">General principles</h2>
  <p>
    The purpose of this project is to make information about caving incidents available in a modern
    and accessible format. For this to be done, incidents need to be categorised, and the
    <strong>metadata</strong> relating to an incident &mdash; such as the cave name or the type of group
    involved &mdash; need to be separated from the content of the incident report itself.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">Editing UI</h3>
  <p>
    When editing an incident, fields which do not have a value, or are marked as <code>None</code> or <code>Unknown</code>,
    are highlighted in red. This does not mean that you are <em>required</em> to fill out these fields before proceeding.
    Rather, it is simply to draw your attention to data that is not held in the database. If you have reviewed the incident
    report and are unable to populate the field based on the data available, you can leave it as it is.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">Data normalisation</h3>
  <p>
    Care should be taken to ensure that information relating to each incident is structured within appropriate fields. The
    <code>Incident report</code> field need not contain a header with the cave name, as the cave name is already stored in the
    incident metadata. Similarly, analysis of the incident should not be in the <code>Incident report</code> field
    as <code>Incident analysis</code> is a separate field. This normalisation of data is critical for producing a consistent
    and accessible database and the principle applies to all fields, not just the ones mentioned above.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">AI generated data</h3>
  <p>
    Incidents are initially extracted from the original ACA Journal PDFs using OCR and then analysed by an AI model which
    extracts metadata and properly formats the incident report. <strong>AI models are prone to errors,</strong> and it is
    important that editors thoroughly check the data which has been generated.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code>Incident report</code> field is automatically compared to the original and flagged if it is significantly different, which
    helps to mitigate the possibility of this information being incorrect. In other cases, however, the AI is asked to make a subjective
    judgement, such as when populating the <code>Category</code> or <code>Primary cause</code> fields. Editors should take extra
    time in reviewing these fields and not hesitate to change them if they are incorrect.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">Approval process</h3>
  <p>
    The incident approval process should be fairly straightforward and is designed to ensure that the data is correct and
    consistent. The process consists of either five or six steps, depending on whether the incident was processed by artificial
    intelligence or not.
  </p>

  <p>
    When clicking the <code>Approve reports</code> menu option, you will be presented with the following pages:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><em>AI incidents</em> &mdash; a page to check the date of the incident is correct.</li>
    <li><em>All incidents</em> &mdash; a page to check the incident report, analysis, references and summary.</li>
    <li><em>All incidents</em> &mdash; a page to add any injured cavers to the injured cavers table.</li>
    <li><em>All incidents</em> &mdash; a page to check the incident metadata.</li>
    <li><em>All incidents</em> &mdash; a page to check the incident flags.</li>
    <li><em>All incidents</em> &mdash; a final review page before the incident is approved and published.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Each page will display either the original pre-AI-processing text, or the edited incident report, as a reference to help you
    determine if the data is correct.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is strongly recommended to read the text at the top of each approval page, at least initially, as this changes
    depending on the type of incident being approved and provides guidance on what to look for.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">Errors after approval</h3>
  <p>
    Incidents may still be edited after they have been approved and editors are encouraged to do so, should they spot any
    errors that need correction. Simply select the "Edit incident" option from the menu and make the necessary changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Editing an incident that has been approved will not 'unapprove' it, and the incident will remain published.
  </p>

  <h2 class="subtitle underline" id="metadataHelp">Incident metadata</h2>
  <h3 class="section less-mt">Date</h3>
  <p>
    The date of the incident. For some incidents, the precise date is not known, in which case the closest month or year
    should be selected, and the <code>Approximate date</code> checkbox used. For example, if we only know that the incident
    occurred in 1970, the date should be entered as <code>1970-01-01</code> and the <code>Approximate date</code> checkbox
    selected. If the incident occurred in June 1970, but no date is given, the date should be entered as <code>1970-06-01</code>
    and the <code>Approximate date</code> checkbox selected.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">Cave</h3>
  <p>
    The name of the cave in which the incident occurred. If the cave name is not known, you must enter <code>Unknown</code>.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">State</h3>
  <p>
    The state in which the incident occurred. Always use the full name of the state &mdash; New York, not NY. If the state
    is not known, the field must be left blank.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">County</h3>
  <p>
    The full name of the county in which the incident occurred. If the county is not known, the field must be left blank.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">Country</h3>
  <p>
    The country in which the incident occurred. If the incident occurred in the United States, you must enter <code>USA</code>.
    For all other countries, the full name of the country should be used. If the country is not known, you must enter
    <code>Unknown</code>.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">Category</h3>
  <p>
    The overall category of the incident. Most incidents will fall into either the <code>Caving</code> or <code>Cave diving</code>
    categories.
  </p>

   <div class="table-responsive">
    <table class="table table-sm">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Category</th>
          <th scope="col">Meaning</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><code>Unknown</code></td>
          <td>It is not possible to determine the category from the incident report.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>Caving</code></td>
          <td>The incident involves a trip into a cave, mine, or other underground space.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>Caving related</code></td>
          <td>
            The incident involves a cave, mine, or other underground space but is not typically caving related &mdash; for example
            a crime committed in a cave.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>Cave diving</code></td>
          <td>
            The incident involves a trip into a cave, mine, or other underground space in which diving equipment was used.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>Other</code></td>
          <td>
            The incident does not fit into any of the above categories. Enter more information in the <code>Notes</code> field if necessary.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">Primary type</h3>
  <p>
    Almost all caving related incidents can be categorised into one of the types listed in the dropdown. Please select the one
    which best describes the incident. If the incident does not fit into any of the available types, you must enter <code>Other</code>.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">Secondary and tertiary type</h3>
  <p>
    These fields are optional and should only be used if the incident can be categorised into more than one type. For example,
    if a caver suffered a fall which was caused by faulty equipment, the primary type would be <code>Caver fall</code> and the
  secondary type would be <code>Equipment problems</code>. In most cases, <code>None</code> will be selected.

  <h3 class="section less-mt">Primary and secondary cause</h3>
  <p>
    These fields are a free form text description of what you feel the causes of the incident were. The secondary cause field should
    only be used when there was clearly more than one cause. Some examples of values found in these fields may be:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Not properly prepared</li>
    <li>Poor judgement</li>
    <li>Inaccurate weather forecast</li>
    <li>Lack of training</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These fields are optional, but it is strongly recommended that you fill in at least the <code>Primary cause</code> field. If no cause
    can be determined, you must leave both of these fields blank.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">Aid type</h3>
  <p>
    The type of aid (rescue) required for this incident. <code>Unknown</code> must only be selected if it is not possible to determine if
    aid was required or not, otherwise <code>None</code> must be used to indicate that no organised rescue took place. If SPAR (self-rescue)
    techniques were used but no external aid was required, <code>None</code> must be selected.
  </p>

  <p>
    If more than one category is met, such as both <code>Surface aid</code> and <code>Underground aid</code>, the most severe category of intervention
    must be selected, which would be <code>Underground aid</code> in this case. If someone died and their body was recovered from a cave,
    <code>Body recovery</code> must be selected.

          <td><code>Surface aid</code></td>
          <td>Aid was provided outside of the cave, such as an ambulance attending after cavers exited.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>Underground aid</code></td>
          <td>
            Aid was provided inside of the cave, such as an organised search party to find lost cavers, or an injured caver was hauled out.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>Body recovery</code></td>
          <td>
            Someone died inside of the cave and their body was recovered by a rescue team.

        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>Aid on standby</code></td>
          <td>
            A rescue team was organised, and may have gone to the cave, but no aid was required.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>Other</code></td>
          <td>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">Group type</h3>
  <p>
    The type of group involved in the incident.
  </p>
  <p>
    This field can be very subjective, and your judgement should be used, in particular when deciding between <code>Cavers</code> and
    <code>Novice cavers</code> or between <code>Novice cavers</code> and <code>Non-cavers</code>.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">Group size</h3>
  <p>
    The total number of people in the underground group when the incident occurred &mdash; <strong>not</strong> the number of injured people or the number
    of people directly involved. Do not include any rescuers that were not part of the original group. If the group size is not known, you must leave
    this field blank.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">Source</h3>
  <p>
    This is the source of the information contained within the original incident report. It is not who <em>submitted</em> it to the ACA Journal, nor
    who wrote the report, but rather who provided the original information regarding the incident. For example, if the incident report is based on a
    report by a newspaper, the source would be <code>Third party</code>. If the source is not known, you must select <code>Unknown</code>.

  <h3 class="section less-mt" id="incidentFlagsHelp">Incident flags</h3>
  <p>
    A number of <em>flags</em> exist, to mark incidents which have certain characteristics. If an incident meets the criteria for a flag,
    the checkbox must be selected. You may select any, or none, of the flags for any given incident.

          <td>
            The incident involved the usage of vertical caving techniques. Do not include simple free climbing in this category. As a general guide, this
            flag should be selected if some equipment, such as a rope, or ladders, was required to ascend or descend the cave.
          </td>

            Self-rescue (SPAR) techniques were used by the caving group to resolve the incident. This does not include any techniques used by any external
            rescue teams which attended later. An example of SPAR would be a caver who fell and injured themselves but was able to exit the cave without
            assistance from their group, or a group which set up a hauling system themselves. This flag must be selected if the SPAR was unsuccessful
            and organised rescue later took place.

  </div>

  <h2 class="subtitle underline">Incident text fields</h2>
  <h3 class="section less-mt">Incident report</h3>
  <p>
    The original text of the incident report from the ACA Journal or submitter of the incident. This field should contain a
    factual description of the events that took place underground <strong>only</strong> and should not contain any
    analysis or references to external publications or resources.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">Incident analysis</h3>
  <p>
    Any analysis of the incident which was included in the original publication. Do not provide your own analysis.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">Summary</h3>
  <p>
    A short (maximum 400 characters) summary of the incident. This should be a factual description of the incident, and you
    may provide the summary yourself. Examples of short summaries may be:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>John Smith (24), fell 10 feet whilst attempting a free climb and left the cave unaided.</li>
    <li>A group of four cavers were trapped by rising water and were rescued by a team of six ten hours later.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">References</h3>
  <p>
    A list of references to external publications, resources, or websites which contain information about the incident. This
    could be caving journal articles, newspaper websites, or other sources of information such as names of cavers who reported
    the incident. If the reference is to a printed publication, the name, author, date, year and page number must be provided if
    available.
  </p>

  <p>Each reference must be entered on a new line.</p>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">Notes</h3>
  <p>
    Any other information which may be relevant to someone reading the incident. Some examples may be:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Some parts of the incident report were missing from the original publication.</li>
    <li>This incident report was later found to be inaccurate in the respect of ...</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="section less-mt">Editing notes</h3>
  <p>
    The editing notes field is only visible to people who are signed in as an editor of the database. It should contain information
    relating to editing only. If the editing notes field is populated, it will be considered as having <em>items to action</em> and
    it will not be possible to approve it. An example of text contained in the editing notes field may be:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Is this cave name correct? I think it is misspelt.</li>
    <li>Is this incident a duplicate of the incident on 1984-05-01?</li>
  </ul>

INTRODUCTION
This issue represents a revival of annual reporting of caving accidents in
the Western Hemisphere by the National Speleological Society. Previous
volumes were published for accidents in 1967-'71, '72, '73, '74 and '75.
This volume brings us up to date. The future will hopefully see annual
issues published by the middle of the year following.
Accidents appear to be basically of three types. First, there are scuba div-
ing accidents in caves, which are almost always fatalities and almost always
involve people who are primarily oriented toward diving, not caving. The
diving fraternity apparently wishes as low a profile as possible, so the
reports in this issue represent only a fraction of the actual occurrences. Se-
cond, there are accidents involving people outside the organized caving
community who use ancient techniques (like knotted rope and hand-over-
hand ascents), minimal equipment (like flashlight only for light source),
and poor judgement. These accidents are often entrapments occurring
when light sources of ascent methods fail. Seemingly just as common are
accidents involving organized cavers for our third type. These also include
entrapments and in general involve more technical situtations than for the
non-organized cavers. Thus, though organized cavers don't commit the ex-
tremely nurdish acts the non-organized cavers do, they seem to get
themselves in trouble quite often anyway. I believe this is due in part to
engaging in underground "rock climbing" without first developing the
skills and adopting the techniques of a rock climber.
In this issue I have labeled reports as either "accident" or "incident" but
drawing the line between the two is difficult. My definition of accident in-
volves the following criteria:
1. An injury occurs, or
2. A caver gets into a situation where the
assistance of another is definitely needed.
Admittedly this results in the inclusion of some rather trivial
"accidents," but at least I don't have to make value judgements on such
things as extent of injury. Various types of incidents are included if I judge
them to be of educational value. Incidents are, after all, accidents that
didn't quite happen.
To avoid class discrimination I have tried not to label the cavers involved
with regard to affiliation or lack of it. I have also tried to name only vic-
tims.
The purpose of this publication is the education of cavers to the real
dangers of caving. Read the reports herein, keep them in mind, and
hopefully you will avoid similar bad situations or at least be better able to
handle them when they occur. Some of these reports are nightmarish, but
they did happen and could happen to you-remember it.
One final message regards the feeling by many cavers that by proclaiming
society to not be responsible for their welfare, that they are thus free to
pursue any irresponsible act that may occur to them. It should be obvious
to any rational person reading these reports that society will not relinquish
its feeling of responsibility toward the freeing of trapped victims or even
the recovery of a dead body. Remember, then, that even if you get yourself
A1

in trouble through outrageous foolishness, others will undoubtedly risk
their lives to aid you.
The information for these reports came from newspaper clippings, direct
reports from cavers or rescue groups and reports in grotto newsletters. If
you see an accident in the newspaper, please send me a copy, including the
newspaper name, date and page number. If you know of an accident and
wonder if I have a report of it, please send a postcard giving brief reference
to the accident and I will let you know if I need more information. When
grotto newsletters publish an accident report, I would appreciate a copy.
Any report of an accident will be greatly appreciated.

SAFETY AND THE NATIONAL SPELEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
The National Speleological Society is concerned with the safety of the
sport of caving within its membership. On a society-wide basis we have the
publication of American Caving Accidents, the Safety and Techniques
Committee and the National Cave Rescue Commission.
The Safety and Techniques Committee, whose present chairman is Allen
Padgett, Rt. 3, Cleveland, GA 30528, is dedicated to the sharing of infor-
mation and experience concerning safe caving methods. Its goal is accident
prevention through involvement of responsible cavers throughout the
society. The committee is open to anyone willing to help. Material is often
published in the NSS News. At the annual national convention of the NSS,
papers are presented on aspects of safety and techniques.
The National Cave Rescue Commission is governed by a board including
a National Coordinator and several Regional Coordinators. The organiza-
tion has garnered expertise in the various specialties of cave rescue. The
NCRC can supply rescue teams and expertise as well as coordination via
liaison with the United States Air Force. For this purpose there is a toll-free
call number, manned 24 hours a day: 800-850-3051. Be prepared to give
your name, phone number, location, nature of the emergency, name and
location of the cave, etc.
The NCRC also conducts cave rescue training seminars annually and
solicits rescue oriented material for publication. Recently published is the
NCRC Handbook of Cave Rescue. For information, write to NCRC c/o
National Speleological Society, Cave Avenue, Hunstville, Alabama 35810.
The NSS also has local chapters called grottos which affect cave safety
within their memberships by the common practice of holding sessions
demonstrating proper safety and techniques. Obviously, a new caver join-
ing a grotto benefits from his observation of safe techniques and practices
on caving trips with established members. Also, some grottos have publica-
tions which occasionally carry articles with material pertinent to safety.
In pursuing the editing of this issue of American Caving Accidents it has
become apparent that there are areas of caving safety which the NSS might
pursue with more energy. First, it seems that cavers who are not associated
with the organized caving scene (the NSS) tend to utilize some outrageously
outmoded techniques and equipment. This includes the lack of head pro-
tection, hand-over-hand descent and ascent, the flashlight as a primary
(sometimes only) light source, and lack of foresight in the form of extra
food and clothing for emergencies. It also seems that experience with
organized caving, whether from education or just peer pressure, creates
cavers who seem never to utilize the items listed above.
A number of accidents occur when a caver takes a fall while climbing
about in a cave. In rock climbing, a climber is inadequately protected if not
belayed when a fall could result in a serious injury (an "exposed" climb).
Rock climbers carry ropes and hardware and train themselves in the use of
these for climbing in exposed situations. So it should be in caving.

REPORTS
Accident: California, Soldiers Cave


********** January 24, 1976
At 12:30 p.m. on Saturday, January 24, Bob Hails (45), Sam Hails,
Frantz Lattka, Dell Quick and Jim Steinberg entered Soldiers Cave. Their
equipment had been inspected a short time before by a National Park Ser-
vice ranger when they obtained permission to enter this restricted cave.
They proceeded down 20 and 60 foot rappels to the Waiting Room and on
to the Waterfall Room via a hand line. Arriving at the Aragonite Room,
they stopped for some prolonged photography. At 2:45 Lattka and B.
Hails went into the northern portion of the room which was separated from
the rest by two narrow crawlways. Lattka climbed a 35-foot, steep
flowstone slope on one wall and went into Ruby's Route, a horizontal
passage at the top of the slope. Hails tried to follow but got up only about 6
feet. Starting to down climb he fell. A foot from the floor his feet hit a pro-
trusion causing him to land in a sitting position with his feet under him.
The others heard the fall and came to help.
Hails complained of pain low in his back and extreme pain in his pelvic
region. He had feeling in his legs and no paralysis or numbness, but could
not stand because of the pain. It was apparent that he would have to be
evacuated and that additional personnel would be required. Extra clothing
and a space blanket were put around him and carbide lamps were applied
to keep him warm. The cave temperature was about 45 degrees. At 3:30 p.m.
Quick and Lattka went for help, exiting the cave at 4:15. Lattka collected
extra gear at the campground, ate and re-entered the cave at 5:30. At 4:45
Quick drove to the nearest ranch to call authorities. At 8 p.m. four rangers
and a volunteer arrived at the campground and at 9 p.m. reached the en-
trance. Lattka exited at that time to report the victim stable. He was sta-
tioned at the entrance with a radio. Quick led the others into the cave and
reached the victim at 11 p.m. EMTs examined Hail who could not move
due to the pain. To get permission to administer pain-killing drugs word
was sent out to Lattka to radio for more assistance, also to include rock
climbing expertise.
At 4:30 a.m. (Sunday) a registered nurse arrived at the site of the victim
and administered morphine. Meanwhile a group of six rock climbers were
rigging the cave with ropes and pulleys. At 6 a.m. Demerol was ad-
ministered and the victim was moved through the crawlways to the main
portion of the Aragonite Room where he was tied on a wooden backboard.
He was then moved by Tyrolean traverse through, up and out of the Water-
fall Room, hoisted up the 60 foot pitch at the Waiting Room, along
another Tyrolean traverse through the crevice, removed from the
backboard to traverse a tight place, hauled up a steep slope and a 20 foot
pitch and again taken off the board to negotiate the tight entrance passage.
The victim exited the cave at about 2 p.m. Sunday, some 26 hours after
entering. His injuries were later diagnosed as a fractured right pelvis.
Reference: Bob Hails et.al. "Accident Report, Soldiers Cave" The
Explorer June 1976 p 50-52.
Analysis: The accident occurred through lack of a belay in the course of
normal caving activity. An upper belay for the less skillful Hails would
A7

---------- Page 7 ----------
surely have prevented the accident. A length of 3/8" nylon rope is easily
carried for use in such situations. For greatest safety, the rule should be
that a belay should be used whenever a fall could cause an injury.
It is obvious that the rescue was carried out with exceptional efficiency.
This is due, at least in part, to the fact that this is a National Park Service
restricted cave and that the Park Service has at their disposal expertise of
various sorts for situations such as this.
Accident: Texas, Fair Oaks Pit


********** February 28, 1976
A group of six were searching for a cave on the Fair Oaks Ranch in Ken-
dall Co., Texas. Some of them had been caving before but none had any
vertical training. At a potential entrance, a 3 'x6' pit, they rigged a home-
made rope ladder. One caver descended 60' down to a floor and looked
around. He found a second pit of 50 but the ladder reached only 10" down
this. Jim Beall (27) with only a flashlight hung around his neck, climbed
down to have a look. The ladder work was being done without belay. Beall
began to climb back out. About 15' from the top he hesitated, then fell. He
hit feet first, rolled 35 down slope and then fell another 50 to the bottom
of the second pit. He was determined to be still alive but the group didn't
have the equipment to reach him. The others were sent to get help which ar-
rived in about 1 1/2 hours.
A medic descended to Beall and tied him to a wooden backboard. The
victim reported that his legs were getting stiff and he was having trouble
breathing. A one inch manila rope and a steel cable were attached to the
stretcher and Beall was lifted into a head-up, vertical position. Beall then
passed out, presumably due to lack of blood flow to the brain from internal
bleeding. Communication between the tow truck winch operator and the
rescue team was difficult and several relays were necessary.
The victim was hoisted by people hauling on the rope and the tow truck
winching the cable. At the top of the 50 (lower) pit, the stretcher hung up
on the lip. Continued pulling on the rope caused, it to break. the loose end
falling back down the pit. The medic at the bottom tried to use this to pull
Beall away from the lip while another caver pulled on the cable. At this
point, however, the cable tore through the wooden backboard allowing the
victim to fall back down the 50' pit. The medic checked vital signs and pro-
nounced him dead.

April 1976 p 70.
Tom Iliffe Personal Communication February 28, 1980.
Analysis: This is another example of cavers using extremely poor techni-
ques and getting in trouble. A belay should always be used in ladder work.
However, it must also be said that the rescue group displayed techniques
just as poor and turned the badly injured victim into a fatality. The rescue
group was local and it is unfortunate that the Texas Cave Rescue System,
(cavers) were not utilized. They could hardly have done worse.

Incident: Arkansas, Lost Hollow Cave


********** March 6, 1976
On Saturday, March 6, Larry Houston and Joe Spitzmiller were prepar-
ing to descend a pit in Lost Hollow Cave, Izard County, Arkansas. A rope
was rigged on a 90 foot drop. To hold the rope clear of the lip, to facilitate
ascent and descent, a chock was placed in a crack and attached to the rope,
with "500 pound test" parachute cord, above the lip. Houston descended
As Spitzmiller put his weight on the rope in going over the lip on rappel, the
chock cord broke, abruptly dropping Spitzmiller about two feet. His hard
hat and lamp were dislodged and fell down the pit. No injury resulted.
Reference: Editor "Dangers of Parachute Cord" The Underground
Leader 6:1 March 1976 p 11.
Analysis: Nylon cord, webbing and rope come in a variety of diameters or
sizes and one should be wary of that which is of insufficient strength. Just
because it is nylon doesn't mean it is strong enough to use indiscriminately.
Moreover, strength will deteriorate with use-inspection before use should
show this. A knot usually reduces strength by half-thus a sling made of
500 pound test cord with a knot would be only 250 pounds in breaking
strength when new. A rappel can be expected to produce stress of up to
several times body weight. Thus it should have been expected that the cord
would break.
Accident: New Mexico, Blue Hole Lake Cave


********** March 10, 1976
David Gregg (21), Mike Godard (22) and eight other university students
were scuba diving in Blue Hole Lake near Santa Rosa, Guadalupe County,
New Mexico. At 10:30 a.m. they began a dive. After a reasonable length of
time Gregg and Godard failed to reappear. The State Police were quickly
called and arrived on the scene at 11:35 a.m.
Search and recovery began at 12 noon and it was determined after the
first dive that the victims were not in the main portion of the lake and had
entered a cave leading off at a depth of 110 feet.
On the 11th a search of the cave was undertaken starting at about 10:15
a.m. On the second dive, at about 2:15, Gregg's body was found in the se-
cond room at a depth of 125 feet. This body was recovered on the same
dive but 11 more dives, up to a depth of 200 feet through March 13th, fail-
ed to yield the second victim. Operations were suspended when exhaust air
from divers began loosening rocks creating an unsafe situation.
On April 25 operations resumed and on the third dive the body of
Godard was located at a depth of about 177 feet. Another dive was
necessary to recover the body.

Albuquerque Journal March 14, 16, 1976.
Analysis: Underwater caving is extremely dangerous and should never be
attempted on the spur of the moment. The exact cause of these fatalities is
not known, but lack of fixed lines to indicate the path of return could have
A9

resulted in disorientation, then failure of lights and finally expenditure of
air supplies. Drowning is not a nice way to die.
Accident: Georgia, Kudzu Cave


********** March 20, 1976
On March 20 a group of eight cavers entered Kudzu Cave, Alabama for a
bop to the bottom. Three had been in the cave previously and most were ex-
perienced cavers, with ages ranging from 23 to 61.
The cave has three drops of 65, 48, and 110 feet. At the second drop the
rope follows a flowstone overhang at first, then hangs free for 35 feet to the
bottom, with the wall about three to four feet away. All descended the first
two drops. Dan Dougherty (61) was the last person down the 48 and sat
down on a rock to derig his vertical gear. One caver had already gone down
the next drop.
At that point (12:10 p.m.) a rock (24"x15"x4") dislodged from the wall
under the overhang, striking Dougherty on top of his left leg, between the
knee and hip. His immediate belief was that it was broken. He began to feel
faint, put his head between his legs and quickly felt better. Palpation of the
bone from underneath revealed no tenderness so it appeared the bone was
not broken, only badly bruised. After ascertaining the extent of the injury,
the victim was moved to a safer location.
One caver then ascended, briefly stopping to examine the site of the
rockfall. With no evidence of additional loose rock, two others ascended.
Dougherty was then able to climb out unassisted using a modified Texas
system with the rest following. A difficult chimney climb-down was
belayed and the 65 foot entrance drop was done unassisted by Dougherty.
He was out by 3 p.m.
The injury was basically a severe bruise of the thigh. After three weeks a
hematoma was diagnosed but not found by surgical examination.

12:5 p 183-184.
Analysis: The victim was fortunate-the rock hit the rock he was sitting on
as well as his leg, lessening the blow to the leg. Those in the party feel that
thev did not touch the rock as they descended It is probably a good idea
for the first person down a drop to check for loose rocks-to clean the
pitch. Also, one should spend as little time as possible beneath a drop.
Accident: West Virginia. Rubber Chicken Cave
May 8. 1976
A group of 11 cavers from the D.C. and Baltimore Grottos were explor
ing a "little known" cave in Greenbriar Countv. West Virginia on May 8.
1976. Three short, climbable pitches near the entrance were rigged with
segments of a homemade cable ladder and a 72 foot free drop with a cable
ladder of commercial construction. To facilitate the movement of this large
group, the three short pitches were ladder-climbed without a belay.
Mike Dyas (32), last in line, was descending the second short drop when,
about halfway down, the ladder failed. The crimps of the top rung, to
which the ladder was rigged, had broken. Dyas landed in a pool of water in
A10
a sitting position. He was soaked but uninjured.
On the way out, a caver was on the 72 foot ladder and ten feet from the
top when the belay rope became tangled. It took half an hour for the caver
to get up the last ten feet.
As Gordon Mothes (late 40's) was laddering the last short pitch the lad-
der broke. Mothes fell several feet, struck his hand on a sharp edge of rock
and received a deep gash near the base of the little finger. He was able to ex-
it the cave unassisted. The laceration later required several stitches.
Reference: Mike Dyas "Accident Report" D.C. Speleograph 32:7 July
1976 p 20, 24.
Analysis: This cave trip demonstrates the dangers both of belaying and not
belaying a cable ladder rigged drop. The belay rope can become tangled,
creating a bad situation. Still, if cable ladders are used they should be
belayed. Home-made or not, it is difficult to tell by visual examination the
strength of a given ladder. Even a short fall can be fatal if one lands wrong.
Accident: Kentucky, Rasdell Cave


********** June 5, 1976
On Saturday morning, June 5, a party of four cavers went to survey a
new stream passage in Rasdell Cave east of Bowling Green, Kentucky. The
new passage was entered by descending two drops of 30 and 25 feet, the lat-
ter with eight feet of very narrow crevice at the top. The first was rigged
with a rope and the second with a cable ladder.
After a long survey trip the group started out. Joe Troester (21) became
stuck in the crevice of the lower drop. Struggling mightily he gradually
made his way up. Two of the group then ascended the upper drop, but
Troester, next in line, found he had expended the strength of his arms in
the crevice and could neither use ascenders nor climb a ladder. Leaving
Troester on a mud bank, the fourth caver ascended and conferred with the
other two. It was decided that the simplest plan would be to get more man-
power and haul Troester out. The group was one of two teams of cavers
surveying caves for the Uplands Research Lab (NPS) so one caver exited
the cave, drove 15 miles and, at 10:30 p.m., picked up the other crew of
four. Troester was hauled up the drop and exited the cave at 1 a.m.
Reference: John Schwartz "Personal Experience and Descriptions of
Caves in the Central Kentucky Karst Plain" The Underground
19:3-4 1976.
Analysis: Exhaustion in an exceptional circumstance cannot be foreseen.
Becoming stuck can easily result in panic and panic can bring on exhaustion
quickly in almost anyone.
Incident: West Virginia, Crookshank Cave


********** June 13, 1976
On June 13, Mike Dyas (32), in company with other cavers, was rappel-
ing the 100 foot entrance drop into Crookshank Cave, Greenbriar County,
West Virginia. As he rappeled it became apparent that the free end of the
rope had tangled on a ledge when thrown down during rigging. When
noticed, the tangle was about ten feet above Dyas. He jerked it loose,
All

dislodging two rocks of about ten and three pounds. Dyas dodged the
larger, but was struck on the helmet by the smaller. Dyas suffered no injury
and so continued.
Reference: Editor "Another Turtle Club Member" D.C. Speleograph
32:9 Sept. 1976 p 18.
Analysis: The initial caver down a drop must expect this sort of hazard.
The caver should not have descended below the tangle before dealing with
it. A good helmet, in this case a Bell Toptex, is an obvious asset.
Accident: West Virginia, Cornwell Cave


********** June 25, 1976
At about 3 p.m. on Friday, June 25, Gale Beach (31) slipped on a rain-
slick rock at the entrance of Cornwell Cave, West Virginia, injuring her
foot. This was an NSS Convention field trip. Consequently, a call to the
convention registration desk produced rescuers within an hour. Beach was
placed on a litter and manually hauled up the side of the 1,000 foot deep
gorge, from the entrance to the road. By 8 p.m. the victim was in a truck on
the way to the hospital. It was determined that she had broken two bones in
her foot.
Reference: Chuck Wilkerson "Cheat River Gorge Rescue" D.C.
Speleograph 32:8 August 1976 p 9.
Analysis: Entrance areas, because of biological activity, can produce ex-
tremely slippery conditions. It is not clear whether the accident actually oc-
curred within the cave or not.
Accident: Kentucky, Sloan's Valley Cave
June 1976
Five cavers entered the Great Rock Sink Entrance of Sloan's Valley Cave
and proceeded to the Big Room via the south overlook, a difficult climb.
They were crossing a sloping ledge in the Lake Room when one slipped and
fell onto the breakdown below. He became wedged between blocks of
breakdown when one moved slightly to pin him. When it proved impossible
for the others to free him, they sent for assistance. The Somerset-Pulaski
County Rescue Squad sent two men with a hydraulic jack. They were able
to free the trapped caver, who was able to leave the cave under his own
power.
Reference: Ken Smith "More on Great Rock Sink" COG Squeaks
Nov. 1976 pp 90, 92.
Analysis: In ordinary caving there seems to be no reason not to carry a 9
mm rope of medium length, say 50 feet, for belaying in exposed situations.
Accident: West Virginia, Crookshank Cave


********** July 4, 1976
In the mid-morning of July 4, Bob Custard and Art and Peggy Palmer
entered the Friar's Hole System via the Crookshank Entrance. They were
part of a larger group using the entrance at that time. The entrance pit is
about 100 feet deep and takes a small stream, usually quite small, which has
A12
carried logs and debris into the pit. About 100 feet further into the cave
from the base of the pit the passage has a narrow cross section and a ten
foot climb-down must be negotiated. This pitch is mainly a log jam.
Custard was about fourth in line but out of earshot of those in front. The
log climb had been done by many cavers and by Custard numerous times.
A log from which one suspended one's self was commonly used. When his
full weight came on the log the soft wood on the sides, where it was jamm-
ed against the rock walls, gave and it fell. Custard landed on his behind in a
reclining position and the log, weighing several hundred pounds, landed
across his pelvis and upper thighs. Sharp rocks under his back barely miss-
ed being driven into his spine.
Art Palmer, in response to a yell of pain, climbed down and managed to
lift one end of the log allowing Custard to roll free. He was examined for
injuries and it was decided that he had no broken bones. It was also decided
that he should exit via the horizontal Snedeggar Entrance about one mile
away. Escorted by Art and Peggy Palmer the trip took about two hours.
The victim gradually succumbed to shock during the trip but made it, thus
making an involved rescue unnecessary. It was later diagnosed that he has
suffered deep bone bruises to the pelvis.

Accident: Montana, Meanderbelt Cave
July 1976
Bill Steele (32) and Bill Liebman (30) entered Meanderbelt Cave in the
Silvertip Mountain Wilderness of Montana. Meanderbelt is an alpine cave
with temperatures near the freezing point. Equipped with wet suits and a 50
foot, 9 mm perlon rope, they proceeded for five hours to the point of fur-
thest exploration, through some very tight, hazardous, and difficult
passage. The continuation was found to be similar, but the slot soon led
out over a deep pit. Thrown rocks indicated a depth of over 100 feet. A
three foot ledge 30 feet below looked reachable. The two were looking for a
connection with Getout Cave and a U.S. depth record and so persisted.
With Liebman holding the rope on belay and wedged in, Steele rappelled
down to the ledge, with the rope being just long enough. A Jumar attached
to his chest harness was then clipped into the rope and the rappel device
was removed. The configuration of the pit still kept him from viewing the
bottom for a possible recognition of Getout, so he traversed the wall to a
flowstone mass with a top area the size of a chair seat. At the "seat" Steele
brought the rope, now a belay, in front of him and unclipped the Jumar to
straighten out the rope. As he did so, he accidently let go and the rope
swung away to rest hanging below the ledge, quite out of reach. Bracing
himself so as not to slip from his perch, Steele communicated with Lieb-
man. After 25 minutes of effort, Liebman was finally able to swing the
rope to Steele and belay him back to the ledge. They proceeded to exit the
cave.
On the way out Liebman, due to the numerous waits during exploration,
A13

nearly succumbed to hypothermia, but was "talked" out of the cave by
Steele.

Analysis: In pursuing the frontiers of cave exploration it is perhaps
justified to take chances and to find one's self in an extraordinary situa-
tion. Hypothermia in very cold caves often occurs to the caver who waits
while someone else pushes.
Accident: Tennessee, Pryor Springs Cave


********** July 11, 1976
On Sunday, July 11, a party of six entered Pryor Springs (Duck Pond)
Cave, Tennessee. The group included six adults, ages 25-30, only two of
which had any previous caving experience. At 2 p.m. they were traversing
the back portion of the cave in a stream passage and were about to enter the
Waterfall Room. Rita Waddell (26) following others through knee-deep
water, stepped into a shallow hole, lost her footing and fell. She put out her
hands to break her fall and lacerated her left hand on a sharp underwater
rock. She was not wearing gloves. There was not a great deal of bleeding so
the wound was treated with large band-aids and the trip continued. After-
wards the victim visited a hospital and the wound was closed with five
stitches.

Analysis: The victim was not wearing gloves. Also, the caver was probably
affected by leader-follower "syndrome"- you are following you
tend to become less aware of what is happening. Even though someone is
leading you still must watch your step.
Accident: Maryland, Crabtree Cave


********** July 19, 1976
On July 19 Steve Woods (24) was exploring in Crabtree Cave near the
Savage Rapids Dam. At a point some 4000 feet from the entrance he suf-
fered a ten foot fall. Once authorities (fire and rescue squads, Maryland
State Police) were alerted, it took three hours to evacuate the victim, main-
ly due to the constricted entrance.

Accident: Indiana, Shaft Cave


********** August 7, 1976
At 11:30 a.m. on Saturday, August 7, Marcus Roberts (21) and John
Dayhuff attempted to enter Shaft Cave near Bloomington, Indiana. They
rigged the entrance drop with quarter-inch, knotted, polypropylene, ski-
tow rope. Roberts tried to descend this hand-over-hand, but twenty feet
down found he could not continue to grip it. He started to ascend, then fell
the remaining 50 feet, injuring his back. Dayhuff contacted the county
police and local NSS members were called. Two cavers entered the pit and
tied the victim to an aluminum emergency stretcher. Three other cavers
coordinated efforts at the top as firemen and police hauled the victim to the
surface. One caver ascended a separate rope, maneuvering the stretcher as
it went up.

Analysis: An example of cavers out of touch with current caving techni-
ques. It is very easy to overestimate one's ability to hold body weight on a
rope, knotted or otherwise.
Incident: West Virginia, Crookshank Cave


********** August 7, 1976
On August 7, a group of seven experienced cavers were in Crookshank
Cave, Greenbrier County, West Virginia, preparing to survey beyond
Lew's Last Climb, a 20 foot pitch. This climb had been rigged with a rope
for ascending a few weeks earlier, with the rope tied off to a span of rock.
As Tom Hay was ascending the span or "natural bridge", it partially
disintegrated. Hay fell about ten feet and landed in a pool. He was soaked,
but unhurt and left the cave accompanied by another caver.

Oct. 1976 p 11.
Analysis: It seems obvious that the anchor had been improperly tested. The
climber may have exerted more force than necessary by a jerkiness in his
ascending method. Smooth, non-bouncy ascending exerts the least force on
the anchor.
Accident: West Virginia, Cass Cave


********** August 29, 1976
On the afternoon of Sunday, August 29, Hans Herron (26) and three
companions entered Cass Cave on Cheat Mountain in Pocahontas County,
West Virginia. One of the four was experienced, the others were not. Not
far into the cave they rigged a 175 foot drop with goldline and made to des-
cend. Herron, with no in-cave vertical experience, was third. At 9 p.m. he
began his descent, but became jammed in the initial crevice portion of the
A15

---------- Page 11 ----------
drop. He released his breaking hand to force himself through, shoving with
both hands. Suddenly he was falling very fast. Instinctively he grabbed the
two prusik safeties and prevented their functioning. He dropped for about
100 feet where he struck a ledge, suffering leg injuries. This caused him to
release the prusik safeties which stopped his fall. He then swung to the op-
posite wall, banging his head, cracking his helmet, and damaging his car-
bide lamp. Swinging back, he again struck the ledge, badly bruising his
ribs. Hanging upside down, he was able to right himself, but then became
quite incapacitated by the pain of his injuries.
One companion ascended and cut the prusik sling which then allowed the
rappel to continue, under control, bringing Herron to the bottom. Herron
had been hanging, injured, for one and a half hours. Another companion
left to get help.
Members of the Marlington Fire Department arrived about midnight
and, in turn, called in a Greenbrier Grotto rescue team for technical
assistance. The Greenbrier crew arrived around 2 a.m. Monday. Bolts were
placed at the top of nearby Suicide Falls, and preparation made to pull
Herron out. Luckily, the water flow was low at the time. At 6:30 a.m. the
victim was placed in a Stokes litter and made ready to be hauled up the 140
feet.
When Herron had been hauled part way up it was noticed that a boulder
was coming loose. He was lowered, made safe under a ledge, and the
boulder was dislodged. On the second attempt, two rescuers went up with
the litter to keep it out of the falls as much as possible, but part way up the
assistants were unable to take the cold and the litter was again lowered. The
victim had been protected from the water by plastic bags.
On the third attempt the lift was shifted to the ropes the cavers had used
to descend the pit. A rope was tied to the foot of the litter so that those on
the bottom could guide it away from the falls and ledges. About 30 feet
from the top the litter was moving quite fast and smashed into a ledge. Her-
ron suffered a forehead laceration which later required stitches. A rescuer
rappelled down and guided the litter up the last bit.
The evacuation was completed to the entrance at about noon Monday, the
rescue taking 15 hours. Herron was found to have a badly broken left leg,
badly sprained left ankle, fractured right heel, bruised ribs, gouged right
knee, a lacerated forehead, and a bad rope burn. Hypothermia was ap-
parently avoided through the use of heat-packs, warm bodies and plastic to
keep the water off.

perience. It should be noted that the prusik safety slings eventually func-
tioned, possibly preventing a fatality.

Accident: Wyoming, Tongue River Cave


********** October 2, 1976
On Saturday, October 2, Fritz Merback (19) and Bill Rimel (18) entered
Tongue River Cave, near Sheridan, Wyoming. They proceeded to the cave
stream, a relatively straight-forward trip from the entrance. In the process
one of their two flashlights was dropped and the batteries went dead on the
other. They were lightly clothed and had no food. A shirt, tapes and some
money were burned to provide heat and light, but these were soon gone.
Huddling together, they waited for rescue.
On Tuesday morning, October 5, the parents of the cavers called a
relative in Sheridan who informed the Sheridan County Sheriff's Office.
Sheridan County Search and Rescue and REACT was called at 11 a.m. and
a few hours later the boys had been found and brought to the surface.
Rimel was weak and had a sore throat; Merback was treated for a minor
cut on the head.

Analysis: The cavers lacked head gear, proper clothing and adequate lights.
Moreover, they left no word of their objective. If the cave had been colder
there could have been two fatalities.
Incident: West Virginia, Rubber Chicken Cave


********** November 13, 1976
A group of five cavers descended the 100 foot pit of the Rubber Chicken
Entrance of the Friar's Hole System in West Virginia at around 5 p.m. on
November 13. They explored until 11 p.m. At that time the outside
temperature was about 10 degrees with surface air blowing down the pit. It
was estimated to be about 30 degrees at the bottom. The cold air and a
waterfall in the pit caused icing of the rope. Two ascended on Gibbs
systems and encountered no problem except minor frostbite due to wet
gloves. The others were on Jumars which slipped on the iced rope. One
made it out by repeatedly warming the Jumars in his mouth. Eventually,
Gibbs systems were relayed down to the stranded pair. The cold caused
almost all to suffer some degree of frostbite and hypothermia.
Reference: Doug Jacoby "Trip Report" Subterranean Sun 6:12

Analysis: A fine example of a deficiency of the Jumar or other toothed,
spring-loaded ascender versus a cam-gripping ascender. On very muddy or
iced ropes, a Jumar will become clogged and slip.

Accident: Kentucky, Cooch-Webb Cave
January 2. 1977
On Sunday, January 2, three cavers entered Cooch-Webb Cave, Hart
County, Kentucky. They were Leo Dolata (30), John Moos and Larry
Royse. Royse had some experience and was equipped with a helmet and
carbide lamp. The other two were without headgear and carried six-volt
lanterns. They planned to visit the dry walking passage near the entrance.
About 150 yards into the cave, at about 3:15 p.m., Dolata stopped to look
down a four foot by eight foot diameter hole where their dry, upper level
passed over and connected with the lower, wet passage. Suddenly, Dolata
seemed to lose his balance, tipped forward and then tried to leap to the
other side. He landed on a steep, loose, smooth mud bank. Facing the slope
he slid backwards for 20 feet, then over a 60 to 80 foot free drop.
The two at the top listened and heard hard breathing. Dolata was con-
scious and yelled up that he had a "compound femoral fracture," using his
experience as a fireman to make the diagnosis. Royse went to get help.
Calls to the local sheriff's office and to Elizabethtown State Police went
unanswered. The Bowling Green State Police responded and in turn called
Corry Crooks of Western Kentucky University, a mountaineer, and called
in a doctor from the local hospital. They obtained a Thomas traction
splint, a 100 foot rope ladder and a narrow stretcher. The ladder was set in
place and Dolata was found to be out of the water on some large rocks. Dr.
Larry Maynard descended and stopped some bleeding, set the leg, and ad-
ministered medication. A litter was rigged from webbing and Dolata was
hauled from the pit. He was evacuated from the cave at about midnight,
some eight hours after entering.

Analysis: To walk up to the edge of a pit and simply fall in seems so foolish
as to be unbelievable. Yet it happened. Many cavers take seemingly un-
necessary chances at the edge of drops.
Accident: Florida, Devil's Eye Spring


********** February 7, 1977
Edward Brodesser (28) and James Ketrow entered Devil's Eye Spring on
the Santa Fe River in Gilchrist County, Florida at 12:35 p.m. on Monday,
February 7. In the cavern they became confused and found themselves
separated. Ketrow started back out and found Brodesser, drowned. Bring-
ing Brodesser to the surface, he attempted artificial respiration, then called
for help from nearby persons. The High Springs Rescue Unit was summon-
ed, arrived, and took the victim to the Shands Medical Center where he was
pronounced dead.

Analysis: Underwater cave exploration is very dangerous even when done
properly. In this case it is obvious even from the limited information that
they were not using safety lines to define their route.

Accident; Tennessee, Indian Grave Point Cave


********** February 20, 1977
At about 4:00 p.m. on Sunday, February 20, four cavers from West
Nashville, Gary Callis (18), Bobby Harrell (24), Larry Hoyal (20), and
Doug Wall (16) went exploring in Indian Grave Point Cave near Smithville,
Tennessee. After a couple of hours their four flashlights and one lamp
began getting dim and it became impossible to find their way out. The
cavers settled down to await rescue, burning their rope to keep warm and
help pass the time. The rope produced enough acrid smoke that they were
forced to move to another room.
Authorities were alerted when the cavers failed to return home Sunday
evening. The search began in the Gordonsville area, the cavers' stated
destination, but at 12:30 p.m. on Monday shifted to Indian Grave Point
Cave near Smithville when the lost men's car was found outside. The search
inside the cave was pursued by five members of the Nashville Grotto.
Forty-five minutes later the lost cavers were found in good condition. They
had spent 24 hours in the 56 degree cave.

sooner if they had left exact word of their objective. They had learned of
the cave by the publication, Caves in Tennessee.
Incident: Mexico, State of Chiapas, Sumidero Yochib
March 1977
On a Spring expedition to Sumidero Yochib in Chiapas, Mexico, Jim
Smith, Mike Van Note, and Bill Steele were pushing along the main stream
passage. A 40 foot waterfall, Froth Pot, was just ahead and the group was
trying to traverse ledges around it so as to rig the pit out of the water, on
the other side. About 40 feet before the falls they had to climb a short but
slightly overhanding ledge. The climb was easy but a slip would be
disastrous to the one who fell, since he would be swept over the falls.
Smith made the climb and anchored a length of nylon webbing to the top.
This angled upward from the lower ledge to the upper and was kept in this
position only by a "slight bulge"; it was not tied at the bottom. Thus, if
one slipped off the wall and held the line he would be saved, but would
swing exhilaratingly out over the river below. Van Note suggested placing a
bolt to anchor the webbing at both ends to establish a true handline, but
this was not done.
On the next trip, Bill Steele climbed up to the upper ledge followed by
Mike Boon 30's). Boon was unaware of the exact nature of the rigging
and was told nothing by Steele. When he climbed up, he used the webbing
for a handhold, popped it off the projection and swung out over the water.
He was able to hold onto the webbing and climb back up to the ledge.

Analysis: In an original exploration, to push the limits of exploration, one
takes whatever chances one thinks appropriate. In this case, to leave an in-

quacies must be judged irresponsible.
Accident: Mexico, State of Chiapas, Sumidero Yochib
March 1977
On a Spring expedition to Sumidero Yochib in Chiapas, Mexico,
Carmen Soileau, Chris Albers, Warren Anderson and Norm Pace (early
30's) were on a trip to lay phone line to Camp I. At one point there was a
cable ladder descent to a canal. The canal led to a falls. A safety line was
strung between bolts at the top of the ladder, the bottom of the ladder, and
a bolt at a point just above the falls. The bottom of the ladder was also clip-
ped into the carabiner at the bottom of the drop it was rigged upon. Pace
descended the ladder and was stringing phone line down the canal when
suddenly the support he had from the canal safety line was gone. He was
swept over the fall, then stopped, still suspended in the 30 cubic foot per se-
cond flow of rushing water. Initially, he was upside down and unable to
breathe. Righting himself, he moved his hard hat over his face, making a
breathing space in the surging water. The buffeting of the water had releas-
ed the canal safety line from the non-locking carabiner at the base of the
ladder. The slack thus produced was enough to suspend Pace, still attached
to the line with a carabiner, directly in the falls.
The rest of the group could do nothing.
After 15 to 20 minutes, the others decided that Pace must be dead and
loosened the rope from the top bolt. The additional slack was enough that
Pace was freed from the falls.

No. 6 May 1977.
Analysis: Obviously a locking carabiner would have prevented this near-
fatality. Buffetting water has a lot of power. It can shred a rope against a
surface or open a carabiner. Pace's presence of mind certainly saved him.
Still, if he had been in the solid flow of that much water, he could have
been torn to pieces.
Incident: Mexico, State of Chiapas, Sumidero Yochib
March 1977
On a Spring expedition to Sumidero Yochib in Chiapas, Mexico, a group
of seven cavers was exiting after a trip to the Terminal Room and were in
the canal swim below the Stinger. Jean Jancewicz led up the canal, follow-
ed by Bill Steele. The canal safety line in place had a knot in the middle
making it inadvisable to safety to the line with a carabiner. Steele yelled a
reminder to Carmen Soileau (27), the next in line, but she failed to hear it
and forgot about the knot. "When she reached the knot she was unable to
A20
pass it and was washed back. She moved forward again and was again forc-
ed back and under the water." She then became tangled in the rope, her
hard hat turned sideways. Steele jumped into the canal and quickly follow-
ed the line back to her. He broke the force of the water, got her to release
her carabiner and pass the knot. Her situation had been serious, and she
was evidently tiring. On the next ladder pitch she failed to self-belay, fell
off the ladder, and had to be grabbed by Steele as she floated by.

Analysis: The rigging of the canal line would have been much improved
without the knot, linking two ropes, in the middle. However, Yochib re-
quired a great deal of rigging and rope, and this was what was available at
that point. Steele did well to keep track of the next person in line. When tir-
ing, it is easy to forget the peculiarities in a long sequence of riggings.
Accident: Missouri, Indian Creek Caverns (Old Mud Cave) March 27, 1977
On Sunday morning, March 27, Doug Beckerdite (20), Gary Blades (20),
Ed Brown (20) and Wayne Smith (18) entered Indian Creek Caverns, in
Stone County about 40 miles south of Springfield, Missouri. They were in-
experienced cavers equipped with flashlights and one electric headlamp. A
note was left on their pickup truck giving the phone number of Ed Brown's
father. A torrential rain had begun to fall Saturday night. This continued
until dawn Monday yielding a total of seven inches of rain.
When the four failed to return on Sunday evening, the Stone County
Sheriff's Office was called. They instituted a search of the area around the
cave and determined that the boys were still in the cave. At 5:00 p.m. on
Monday, Dave Neff, a caver and former advisor to the School of the
Ozarks Troglophiles, was called. He quickly organized a group of rescuers
including an Emergency Medical Technician. At the cave entrance, a half-
mile from the road, they formed two search parties. The first entered the
cave at 8:00 a.m. and visited the dry upper levels. The second party waited
for the arrival of wetsuits for a search of the stream level.
The first group soon met with chest deep water with a six inch air space
and further on had to swim. Three members of the group turned back
at
the water and the other three continued. The water level in the cave was
some five feet above normal and few could remember when the cave had
last flooded like this. The rescuers were hoping that the four would be sit-
ting out the flood in the dry upper levels. At 9:00 a.m., only 390 feet from
the entrance and shortly before the junction where the upper level began,
however, the four overdue cavers were found. They were lying together in
about 2 1/2 feet of water, dead.
With the arrival of wetsuits, the bodies were removed, all being out of
the cave by 11:30 a.m. The county coroner assigned drowning as the cause
of death.

Robert Sanford "A Rising Torrent and Tragedy in a Cave"
St. Louis Post Dispatch March 1977.
Analysis: Neff reports that the body recovery team found the bodies ar-
ranged more or less in a line, with the hands of the hindmost "clutching
tight on the sides of the third man at chest level, the third man had his
hands clutched identically on the second and likewise this man on the lead
man. This lead man was not holding on to anyone but was clutching a pair
of glasses in one hand by their bridge with the two earpieces sticking
straight ahead, unfolded." The lead man also had an electric headlamp,
strapped around his neck, with the headlight resting on his chest, still glow-
ing, powered by a six volt lantern battery. A flashlight was in his other
hand. The group was facing back into the cave. Neff speculated that they
tried to get out Sunday evening, found the cave too flooded, went back to
the upper levels, then headed out again on Monday morning, only to be
turned back again. They then succumbed to hypothermia. Neff feels the
still burning headlamp indicates this since a lantern battery wouldn't burn
for more than ten hours and thus a fresh one had to have been affixed early
Monday morning, presumably before they started out the second time.
This is a very bizarre situation. The coroner pronounced death by
drowning due to water present in the victims' lungs. Yet, if this is so, why
were the bodies joined as if following the leader in a desperate situation? If
the group were moving along the cave, found the water too deep and began
to drown, there is no possibility they would remain holding to each other in
the orderly fashion rigor mortis left them in. The death throes from suf-
focation demand a terrific struggle and an arbitrary grasping and grabbing.
Hypothermia is the likely answer but the recreated scene is still a strange
one. The group, cold from getting wet when they first found the cave en-
trance flooded, huddles for hours as hypothermia sets in. Then, perhaps
with only one person still capable, they decide to try again, a desperation
attempt. They proceed single file each holding on to the one in front while
in the deep water-perhaps only the leader had a workable light, certainly
only he had the strength and resolve to keep them going. Then they found
the entrance still blocked-they would have to go back. As they headed
back to wait some more, their strength and resolve faded. The leader col-
lapsed. Since he was the force keeping the others going, they succumbed at
that time as well. Dying, they fell over, still holding to each other, taking in
some water with their last breath. Still, to be lying there together holding to
each other underwater, they had to have died at the same time. The odds
against this are very high. Yet it seems to have happened.
One last note is that in this case the cavers don't seem to have been ir-
responsible. The cave apparently floods only under very extraordinary cir-
cumstances.

Accident: Mexico, Oaxaca, Sotano San Agustin


********** March 28, 1977
In March of 1977 a group of cavers was on the Huautla Plateau in the
state of Oaxaca of Mexico for an extended push of Sotano de San Agustin.
On March 26, three cavers entered to establish a camp at - 1,800 feet. They
wre joined the next morning by three more.
On the 28th, a third group of six cavers headed for the underground
camp. They proceeded for some time along the route which is mainly a
series of vertical drops. About half the drops have waterfalls and some are
more difficult than usual by virtue of not being free falls. The air and water
temperature is about The cavers were heavily laden with duffle bags
of gear and food.
At about 1,200 feet they came to the top of the longest drop, a pit of
about 320 feet. Jean Jancewicz and Bill Steele proceeded down. As Blake
Harrison (28) was traversing a canyon leading to the top of this pit, and in
the midst of a difficult straddle, he lost his footing and fell.
He was not clipped into a handline that was present and fell about 30 feet
down the narrow canyon, bouncing from wall to wall, finally landing on a
sand floor. The fall was audible to Jancewicz and Steele and just afterward
Jill Dorman screamed down the drop for help. This was incoherent to those
below who feared damage to the rope and so did not ascend. Eventually
they became cold, and continued on to the camp.
Jim Smith had previous EMT training and checked the victim's neck and
spine for fractures, finding no evidence of such-neither the pain nor
numbness associated with such injuries was present. Harrison did appear to
have serious injuries and delirium indicated a possible concussion. With
Mike Van Note and Jill Dorman staying with Harrison, Smith proceeded to
the surface to get supplies.
On the surface, Smith found that another group had arrived, consisting
of Bill Liebman, Joe Liberz and Maureen Cavanaugh. The combined
group, armed with equipment for the evacuation but almost no food, pro-
ceeded to the accident site. Harrison was less badly injured than at first
thought and was able to aid himself to some extent. The evacuation was
carried out by the five cavers over the next 31 hours almost non-stop. The
lack of food became a serious handicap, however, and toward the end the
rescuers were running on adrenalin and body tissue-potential victims
themselves. On ascending the drops the counterweight lift method proved
most useful.
Once out, Harrison was trucked to Tehuacan, a day's drive away, to the
nearest hospital. He was diagnosed as suffering a broken rib, broken
finger, and minor lacerations and contusions.

Blake Harrison Personal Communication April 1980.
Analysis: Harrison's personal life was in conflict at that time and it is felt
by some that this contributed to the accident. The place where he slipped,
after all, was not outrageously difficult and had been traversed by a
number of others. Certainly, if Blake had clipped into the rigged hand line
A23

---------- Page 15 ----------
he would not have taken the fall he did, although one person pointed out
that slack in the line would still have allowed a six to eight foot fall.
The lack of communication between those above and below the 320 foot
drop would have been improved by the use of whistles and the five-mode
European whistle signal system. It is difficult to criticize any particular
situation, but the rule should be that every effort be made to re-establish
communication when a party is separated as happened here.
The Ultimate helmet worn by Harrison certainly saved him from serious
head injury. A helmet with simple elastic chin strap would probably have
come off the first time he hit, leaving his head unprotected on the further
bounces off the walls of the canyon.
The lack of food taken back into the cave for the rescuers was a serious
problem. Everything possible should be done to prevent rescuers from
becoming victims.
Accident: Mexico, Oaxaca, Sotano de San Agustin


********** March 31, 1977
In late March 1977, a large group of cavers was on the Huautla Plateau
in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, to explore Sotano de San Agustin. All were
equipped for a multi-day stay in the cave. Three entered the cave on March
26th and established a camp at about 1,800 feet. They were joined the
next day by three more. On the 28th a group of six entered, but an accident
at 1,200 feet (see previous report) resulted in an evacuation of the injured
caver. Two of this party had descended a 320 foot drop when the accident
occurred at the top of this drop and communication was lost. These two
continued on to the camp at 1,800 feet.
On the 30th, Warren Heller, who had found his thermal underwear
covered by waterproofs unsuited for wet push trips, did not take part in the
push but de-rigged a route bypassed by an easier way. When the push crew
returned to camp they found he had packed up and gone. It was known
that he had to return to a job, but since several others had to leave the
following day, there was no reason for him to leave alone.
On the 31st, five cavers had reached the end of their planned stay-the
end of their food supply. Two drops above camp they came to the base of
the longest drop in the cave, a 320 footer, and found no rope. Dismayed,
they returned to - 1,800 feet and re-established camp with the two who had
not tried to leave. Thus trapped by the missing rope were Richard
Schreiber, Gerald Moni, Marion Smith, Steve Knutson, Don Broussard,
Bill Steele and Jean Jancewicz (late 20's and early 30's).
Regarding food, the situation was not too bad. Some food had been left
by previous expeditions and the two who had entered on the 28th had foor
for at least several days. The worst problem was that Broussard, a diabetic,
had no more insulin. In a few days, perhaps a week, he would go into shock
and then die not long after. If the entrapment lasted several days there was
a good chance he would have to be evacuated. He had extra insulin on the
surface and taught others how to give him injections.
On April 2, four cavers couldn't stand the wait and went on a push trip
to a new passage near the bottom of the cave.
On April 4, several persons went to attempt a climb of the 320 foot pit.
A24
This seemed futile as they had only eight bolts and some makeshift chocks
for the 320 foot climb. As they reached the bottom of the drop, however,
they heard a caver at the top. It was Joseph Lieberz, who was the first of
the rescuers recuperating from the evacuation of Blake Harrison to descend
to do some caving. Those who wished to leave, including Broussard, left
without incident.

Express 3:3 Summer 1977 p 42-44.
Analysis: It appears that Heller, while exiting, used the rope at the 320 foot
drop to haul his duffel up after him. On throwing the rope back down, it
hung up not far below the lip. Heller had been told that the rope, when
thrown down the drop during rigging, would hang up in this way and, in-
deed, he was first down this drop on this expedition and found the rope
hung up as predicted. Heller contends that the rope got caught on his
equipment and was accidentally hauled up.
In general, the situation for those trapped was not serious since they
could stretch their food supply for many days. Broussard's lack of insulin
was quite serious, however, and should never have been allowed to happen.
Necessary medication should always be taken in extra supply.
Accident: California, Connie's Cave


********** April 2, 1977
On April 2, a group of nine cavers, six adults and three teenagers, visited
Connie's Cave in Amador County, California. The cave is primarily
horizontal with two entrances, one requiring a descent of a 45 degree slope
and the other, 15 feet higher, is a rope drop down a pit to the top of the 45
degree slope.
The vertical entrance was rigged with 5/16 inch Bluewater II. Laura St.
Louis (late teens) had previously practiced rappel but was hesitant to pro-
ceed and had to be encouraged. She was put on rappel with "one of two
sets of brakebars on the rappel rack." This was insufficient friction for her
weight on the thin rope. Her initial descent was so rapid that she released
her control hand and grabbed the rope with both hands above the rack. She
fell about 12 feet, hit the 45 degree slope, and tumbled down that for
another 20 feet, coming to a halt when the rack caught on the knot tied on
the end of the rope. A first aid kit was lowered to two cavers at the top of
the slope and the victim was treated for rope burns. She then left the cave
under her own power.
Reference: Jim Fiack "Accident Report" Valley Caver 16:2
March-April 1977 p 26.
Analysis: If someone else had gone down first the amount of friction
necessary on the rack would have been known. An experienced caver would
have gotten on rappel near the anchor and before going over the edge,
would have put at least full body weight on the rack to test the friction, ad-
justing the number of bars as needed. Gloves should always be worn.

Incident: Alabama, 23 Dollar Cave


********** April 2, 1977
At about 7 p.m. on Saturday, April 2, three cavers entered 23 Dollar
Cave in Alabama. About an hour later they were at the bottom of the
seventh drop, signed the register and started out. At the fourth pit Lona
Brown went ahead while the other two derigged. The water was up and it
was apparently storming outside. As the two neared the 80 foot entrance
drop they heard what they thought was mud and rocks falling. Mark
Lassiter then encountered a copperhead when he went to rig into the
rope. The rope was moved to one side but as he went again to rig in,
another snake fell from above and he backed off. By rigging the rope to the
bolt at the second drop and climbing at a 75° angle, they were able to climb
past the snakes. No snakes were encountered at the lip as feared and the
two exited the cave without further incident.
Reference: Buddy Lane "23 Dollar and the Night the Copperheads were
Falling" Speleonews 12:2 April 1977.
Analysis: This incident may seem trivial but it points out that poisonous
snakes, spiders, scorpions, bears, mountain lions, and other dangerous
critters do inhabit entrance areas of caves.
Accident: Tennessee, Cumberland Caverns


********** April 16, 1977
On Saturday evening, April 16, Jeff Cresswell (15) was with a group on
the overnight spelunker tour at Cumberland Caverns, a commercial cave in
Tennessee. In the Gypsum Crawl, Cresswell was stooping to enter a low
crawlway when someone behind and above him dislodged a 15 pound rock.
The rock fell about four feet striking Cresswell in the small of the back. He
experienced great pain and numbness in his left leg. Fearing a spinal injury,
the victim was kept immobile. A registered nurse in another tour party was
brought to the aid of the victim. The Warren County Hospital Ambulance
Team was called and two EMT's arrived within 45 minutes. They were
transported to the end of the Big Room in a station wagon. The victim was
slowly and carefully hauled about 400 feet through the Gypsum Crawl, ex-
periencing considerable pain even though strapped to a flat board stret-
cher. He was removed from the stretcher at one point to be moved through
a constriction. The evacuation took about 1 1/2 hours. It was later determin-
ed that there were no broken bones or serious injuries.

of climbing above someone or of being below someone who is climbing.
Accident: Maryland, Sheepman's Cave


********** May 23, 1977

Accident; California, Palos Verdes Peninsula Sea Cave


********** June 11, 1977
On Saturday, June 11, Patrick Ivicevich (16) and Robert Cowan )16) of
Harbor City were swimming at a rocky ledge that juts out from Inspiration
Point near Portuguese Bend on Palos Verdes Peninsula. The two were
periodically diving into the water 10 to 15 feet below the ledge. One of the
youths jumped in just as a powerful wave crashed in and was swept into a
partly submerged cave. A fisherman, Mike Wilson, in a rubber raft, paddl-
ed furiously against the current to reach the two. As he approached the
cave another huge wave struck, overturning the raft and casting him into
the cave. Nearby beach-goers rushed along the rocks to help but could do
nothing in the treacherous surf. Cowan was soon swept back out of the
cave, was given mouth-to-mouth resuscitation by onlookers and revived.
Fifteen minutes later the tide brought out the dead body of his companion.
Cowan received only minor injures. The fisherman's body was not
recovered.

Analysis: This was not a voluntary caving trip. Even so, some awareness of
the hazard posed by the wave-by-wave flooding sea cave by those carrying
on recreation activities near it might have saved the two lives lost.
Incident: Pennsylvania, McClure's Cave
Summer 1977
A group of seven cavers were visiting McClure's Cave in Pennsylvania in
the summer of 1977. After a tiring exploration the group made to exit. All
were anxious to leave and proceeded into the New Extension Crawl, a very
low, tight passage, all together. When a novice became stuck there was a
delay. All soon began to experience symptoms of "hypoxia and carbon
dioxide poisoning," rapid panting, extreme headaches and rapidly advanc-
ing exhaustion. Before anyone succumbed, they were able to proceed.
Reference: Editorial "Cave Pearls" The Dripstone Spring 1979 9:2
Analysis: An interesting situation. Some caves are low on oxygen or high in
carbon dioxide but not to the extent one would normally notice.
Accident; West Virginia, Organ Cave


********** July 9, 1977
On July 9, 1977, George Dasher (25), Liz Hall and Chris Welsh entered
Organ Cave in West Virginia via the Lipps Entrance. Their aim was to map
a newly discovered area, the Belfry. They are experienced cavers but it was
Welsh's first trip into Organ Cave.
Going in they rigged a short climb with webbing attached to a boulder of
A27

---------- Page 17 ----------
about 500 pounds lying flat on a flat floor. On another pitch a handline and
3-rung direct-aid etrier was rigged to a 2x4 wedged into a narrow, overhead
slot. Dasher was unable to negotiate a tight place beyond this and so re-
mained behind while the others surveyed on. He had passed his pack
through the constriction and it was not passed back when he turned around
so he arrived at the drop without it. Dasher went down both handlines to
refill his carbide lamp with water. He sat down to wait.
After a while he heard a rock fall and went up the boulder-anchored line
to investigate. Nothing seemed to be occurring so he went down again and
went to sleep.
Upon awakening he found his lamp growing dim so he ascended to the
constriction to call to the others to hurry up. On the way up he noticed that
the boulder sling appeared to have slipped. As he descended that drop it ap-
peared to slip again. Actually, the mud-covered rock was not whole and
part was rocking. As he leaned back and put weight on the handline, this
part pulled over the edge. Dasher and the rock fell to the bottom.
A breakdown block at the bottom caught Dasher's right foot and the
falling rock at the same time, smashing his foot and twisting his leg as his
body continued. His helmet flew off as he fell the remaining short distance
to the floor.
Dasher was in great pain but soon determined that he was still func-
tional. He yelled to the others who were on their way, having heard the
rock fall. In a few minutes they reached the top of another drop which,
already rigged, led to Dasher from the area being surveyed. They went back
for their packs and in 45 minutes were at the victim's side.
Carbide lamps had to be recharged and lit with matches by the light of
cylumes, their strikers being too muddy to operate. The group then exited
the cave with Dasher using the 2x4 as a crutch but still having to crawl in
some of the walking passage. He was later found to have no broken bones.

Analysis: When anchoring a line one should, by kicking, pounding, pulling
or pushing, do one's best to establish that the point of anchoring is stable
and strong. If rappelling, one should then get on rappel and try to exert as
much force as possible on the anchor before going over the edge and ac-
tually starting the rappel.
The victim was apparently lucky that the rock did not strike him more
fully.
Dasher should not have gotten himself separated from his cave pack. He
was using a flashlight at the moment of the accident since his charge of car-
bide has been expended. More light might have shown him what was occur-
ring with the anchor.
Accident: West Virginia, My Cave


********** July 30, 1977
On Saturday afternoon, July 30, Jeffrey Allen Gerhart (22) and three
companions entered My Cave in Pocahontas County, West Virginia. They
were lightly clothed, wearing jeans, shirts and tennis shoes, and had only
A28
two flashlights. They passed the small entrance and proceeded a few hun-
dred feet to the top of a descent sloping from 45 to 60°. Gerhart started
down, slipped on the slick mud and fell 40 feet to the bottom. Unfortunate-
ly he fell such that he hit the slot opening to an 86 foot drop and plum-
meted down that as well.
The group had no climbing equipment or ropes and Gerhart's compa-
nions could only go for help. They called the State Police and help soon ar-
rived. A State Trooper, J. M. Kuykendall, lowered himself on a rope down
the mud slope and determined that Gerhart had indeed gone over the
deeper drop. The Riverton and Valley Head Rescue Squads, a Civil
Defense unit and several science camp counselors were summoned and ar-
rived at the cave at about 7:30 p.m. The victim was found dead. The body
evacuation was not completed until 9:30 Sunday morning.

Analysis: The cavers were "just looking around" and were obviously poor-
ly equipped. Flashlights don't allow the full use of the hands in climbing
and tennis shoes can hardly be called adequate footwear. The cave
temperature of 47° presented a hypothermia hazard to the rescuers and it is
speculated that the lightly clothed Gerhart would have succumbed to
hypothermia if he had survived the fall.
Accident: West Virginia, Canadian Hole


********** July 31, 1977
At 11 a.m. on Sunday, July 31 Ralph Kennedy (28) and Patty Mothes
entered Canadian Hole, a part of the Friar's Hole System in West Virginia.
They were wearing wet suits and had vertical gear for the drops in the cave
and a proposed bolt climb to an unexplored high lead.
They rappelled the first drop (44 feet) and down-climbed the next two
short ones. All were rigged with cable ladders. The third drop took them
directly to the top of the fourth drop, feet). There water rained
down. A cable ladder was rigged and a rope was tied to the last rung of the
ladder on the previous drop. Mothes checked the rope rig and thought it to
be OK-Kennedy gave it a cursory look and got on rappel. As he eased
over the edge, the knot came undone and Kennedy fell free to the bottom.
Kennedy landed feet first suffering severe injury to his right foot and
ankle. Trying to stand, he found he could put no weight at all on that foot.
It was quickly decided that the situation was potentially hypothermic and
that Kennedy could prusik using his left foot in a Texas system. The rope
was tied to the ladder, hauled up, and re-rigged. The two then carefully
made their way out, Kennedy needing some assistance at the third drop.
The victim was later found to have suffered three broken bones in his right
foot and a severely sprained ankle.
A29

Reference: Ralph Kennedy "Accident Report" Baltimore Grotto News
16:7 December 1977 p 51-2, 55.
Analysis: Kennedy reported that he was anxious to continue due to the
wetness at the top of the drop. The rigging was that of Canadian cavers
who commonly climb up and down cable ladders with a belay, rather than
rappel and ascend (prussik) a single rope. The rope was thus intended to be
used as a belay rope and was tied to the lowest rung of the previous ladder
only for convenience, with what Kennedy described as a slip knot. It was
not intended to be used for rappel. Whatever the knot was, it was obvious-
ly tied only loosely. Kennedy seems correct in his analysis that the accident
was due to carelessness and the mixing of two rigging styles.
Accident: Alabama, Cave near Lake Purdy


********** August 8, 1977
At about 10 a.m. on Monday, August 8, Scott Mitchell (15) and Ken
Grund (15) went exploring in a cave near Lake Purdy in Alabama. They
were in the main passage when they "saw some bats and began throwing
mud balls at them and chasing them." In the course of this sport they paid
no attention to landmarks. When they went to exit they found themselves
lost. The cave is complex but they had no choice but to try to explore their
way out. They tried following the many strings and wadded them up one by
one as they failed to lead out. Each of the many alternative routes they
tried led to a dead end. Still, they tried to be systematic and marked each
unsuccessful try. One flashlight went out and the other grew very dim.
At about 6 p.m. they had grown tired and had picked a spot to sleep, out
of the mud and water. Suddenly they heard a voice. Grund shouted and,
with difficulty because of the many echoes, they made contact with a Sun-
day School outing group who led them out of the cave.
Reference: Carl Carter "Leeds spelunkers, 15, spend harrowing hours
lost in cave" Birmingham News Aug. 12, 1977.
Analysis: Spur-of-the-moment caving with poor equipment led to this
situation. The chance encounter was lucky since the boys would not have
found their way out without light.
Accident: West Virginia, Cass Cave


********** August 28, 1977
On Sunday, August 28, Reginald White (21) and three companions
entered Cass Cave in West Virginia with the intention of doing a three day
camp in the cave. When they arrived on the 27th they encountered a Sligo
Grotto group, leaving, who advised them of conditions in the cave and
against camping there. Only one of White's group had been in the cave
before and they had only one set of ascending gear between them.
They proceeded to the 175 drop and rigged a Perlon rope directly in the
falls. One declined to descend. The others rappelled without incident. Several
hours were spent exploring. At about 6 p.m. they were returning and beginn-
ing their ascent of the drop. The first man up the drop was forced to momen-
tarily de-rig from his chest Gibbs to get past a ledge. He continued his ascent
without incident and lowered the ascending gear to the next man.
A30
Between 6:30 and 6:45 p.m. White began his ascent. As he was trying to
pass the ledge he dropped a piece of equipment and then fell backwards,
hanging by his knee and foot ascenders, unable to hold himself up against
the strong force of the water. After 90 minutes White ceased to respond to
attempts at communication, and at 8:15 the companion at the top left the
cave and called authorities at The Greenbank Observatory. Greenbank in
turn called the local rescue squad and the Greenbrier Grotto. Meanwhile
locals returned to the cave and decided that the victim had died.
At 12:00 a.m. Greenbrier Grotto personnel entered the cave and rigged
the Belay Loft for rappel and hoisting. A medical student wearing a wetsuit
descended and rigged White into a Neil-Robertson Stretcher so that he
could be lowered to the floor. An accident nearly occurred with load was
applied to the line in lowering. The medic was pulled off the ledge and fell
20 feet on slack in his belay line. The lowering was completed. Meanwhile
telephone wire was laid from the entrance to the Belay Loft to keep things
organized.
t 4:45 a.m. the hoisting rig was completed and the two companions to the
victim were taken up. When the body was lifted the stretcher fouled in the
telephone and rappel lines at a narrow spot near the top. A man had to
jumar down to free it. The body evacuation was completed by 10 a.m. The
med student was exhausted by his efforts and was also hoisted up the pit.

Analysis: The victim's party was not familiar with the cave and had plann-
ed much more than they were capable of. It appears they did heed the ad-
vice of other cavers and scale down their aims or this might have been a big-
ger accident. In serious vertical caving such as this it is foolish to rely on
just one set of gear. The ascending rig would have been better with the
ascenders safety-rigged to a seat sling so that one is sitting rather than hang-
ing upside down if the chest support fails. The survivors are lucky one of
them had gotten up the drop and was able to go for help.
Accident: Missouri, Henson's Cave
August 1977
In late August a 19-year-old Oklahoma City woman went with friends to
Henson's Cave in McDonald County, Missouri. Past the entrance crawl the
woman was standing in some water when she was bitten by a bat. A compa-
nion struck the bat with a coat. In Oklahoma City the bat was determined
to be rapid by health officials. The woman was treated for rabies. The cave
was later closed by the Missouri Dept. of Highways.

Analysis: Bats can carry rabies even when not affected by it. Any scratch or

bite received from a bat should be suspected for rabies infection. Any bat
crawling about should be suspected as rabid and avoided.
Accident: Alabama, Valhalla Cave


********** September 3, 1977
Around noon on Saturday, September 3, three cavers prepared to enter
Valhalla Cave, Jackson County, Alabama. Valhalla is an extensive cave
with a 227 foot freefall entrance drop. Not knowing the depth of the pit,
they rigged a rope which appeared to reach the bottom. Only one was inex-
perienced in vertical caves and it was decided that he should go second. The
first to descend was William Siler (58). He proceeded to rappel off the end
of the rope which was 10 to 20 feet short of the bottom. Kent Burchfield
lowered more rope and rappelled to the victim. He diagnosed a broken arm
and possible back injuries. The third member of the group then jogged
down the mountain to summon aid.
Birmingham was first called and a group of cavers left for the accident
scene, 150 miles away. The Huntsville Police Department and Madison
County Rescue Squad were also notified and called local cavers to get direc-
tions to the cave. Naturally enough the competent cavers involved
themselves. These arrived at 5 p.m. to find the road up the mountain clogg-
ed with police and private cars, necessitating a two mile hike.
At the cave three lines were rigged and the victim was to be raised on one
by manpower at the top while two rescuers ascended at either side. The ex-
cess manpower, police and locals, was put to work planning the evacuation
off the mountain side. This kept most of them away from the pit edge.
At the bottom, the victim's broken right wrist was splinted; he was wrap-
ped in a space blanket, administered a mild sedative and strapped into a
basket litter. The lift went quickly and smoothly and the victim was out by
8 p.m. By 10:30 p.m. he had reached a hospital.

Analysis: According to Siler, mist part way down the pit caused them to
misjudge the depth. Obviously, a suitable knot in the end of the rope would
have prevented the accident but it must be said that it is rather careless to
rappel off the end of a rope under any circumstances.
The rescue call-up was not smooth. The cavers did not know who to call
and the MCRS dispatcher had lost the list of local cavers.
Accident: Arkansas, Rorie (Jack Mitchell's) Cave


********** September 5, 1977
At dusk on September 5, Jerry Derbyshire, David Smith, Jim
Blackfeather, Louis Alderman and R. C. Schroeder entered Rorie Cave,
Stone County, Arkansas. Derbyshire is a journalist and was on assignment
from an adventure magazine. Schroeder and Smith are experienced cavers
A32
and the last two able outdoorsmen and occasional cavers. This was to be a
photo trip for the magazine photo essay. The cave is reported to be 300 feet
long with two levels.
Some distance into the cave, Smith, seeking an easier route out of a
room, attempted to climb to an obvious crawl lead about 20 feet up the
wall of a room which also contained a pit. Smith had requested that
Schroeder spot for him by bridging the pit. This proved to be impossible.
Fifteen feet up, Smith lost his footing and fell backward, striking his head
and shoulders on the edge of the pit. To the horror of those watching, he
continued his fall into the 20 foot pit and after hitting the bottom, careened
down a 25 foot talus slope to a pool of water. Schroeder quickly negotiated
the difficult route to where the victim lay, at the bottom of the talus slope,
partly in the water. He was breathing heavily but could not be aroused; his
head had 5 or 6 two inch cuts that were bleeding profusely and his lips were
badly torn and bleeding. A couple of minutes later Alderman and
Blackfeather arrived. The latter is a licensed practical nurse and checked
Smith for obvious broken bones, finding none. To guard against hypother-
mia, the victim was eased out of the water but there was really no safe or
comfortable place for him.
Smith regained consciousness but was not coherent. Derbyshire and
Schroeder went for help and blankets. At the nearest house they called for
an ambulance and sent word to Richard Neidhardt and John Weaver to-
bring gear for a vertical rescue.
With Dave Webb, three blankets and a dacron sleeping bag, they return-
ed to the scene of the accident. Deputy Sheriffs Kirk Hicks and Troy Haney
arrived about 15 minutes later with two stretchers (flat board and
aluminum frame canvas), a 30 foot rope lariat, and a first-aid kit. Com-
presses were applied to the victim's head and he was strapped to the board
stretcher so that it would bend with him at the waist. Their choice was to
take him out up the pit he had fallen down, with unstable talus to contend
with, and through a passage with tight bends, or through a "corkscrew"
crawl. The pit, which narrowed at the top, seemed best. At this point Dick
Neidhardt and John Weaver arrived with vertical gear.
The first attempt to raise the victim was unsuccessful. It was too tight at
the constriction. The victim was then taken out of the stretcher, a rope tied
around him under the armpits and a second attempt was made. The victim
had now recovered sufficiently to aid in his removal. Once up the pit, a
safety line was attached and, with much assistance, he was walked out of
the cave. In the process he was hoisted up two more climbs and down one
at the entrance. Two men assisted him up the very steep trail from the cave
to the ambulance. Besides the lacerations to the head and lips, Smith was
found to have a mild concussion and a chipped vertebrae. He was
hospitalized for a week.

pelled to aid us in time of accidental injury. This fact should temper our
judgement. To my way of thinking we should also temper judgement by the
importance of what we are attempting. An exposed, difficult climb should
always be belayed. In ordinary caving when one is faced with such without
a rope, the safe thing to do is go home and get one.
Incident: Kentucky, Morrison's Cave


********** September 10, 1977
On September 10, Jim Borden, Don Coons and Mark Stock entered
Morrison's Cave in Barren County, Kentucky. They proceeded to a 30 foot
drop with a dome over it. Borden down-climbed the pit via a narrow ca-
nyon while Coons and Stock ascended the very steep, unstable, mud and
rock wall to look for leads at the top of the dome. About 40 feet up they
reached the top where a crawlway led off. This needed digging out so they
yelled to Borden to beware. Then Coons began to dig with Stock behind
him, bridging the dome at the ceiling. The digging apparently caused vibra-
tions and small rocks began to fall out of the ceiling around Stock's head.
As Coons wriggled into the crawl, Stock took notice of a 1x2x1 foot rock
above him with nothing to support it. As he moved to one side, it and much
debris around it, plummeted into the pit, knocking the lamp off Stock's
helmet. At the same time another rock 4.5x3x1 feet slipped down onto
Stock's shoulder and smaller rocks fell all around him.
Coons, in the crawl, gave Stock some light. Stock then grabbed Coons'
foot and made a desperate lunge into the crawl. The boulder, as it and
material around it groaned and fell, missed him by only a foot. The two
then watched as "the unstable ceiling would gasp and moan in a most
grotesque manner as the rocks and mud would settle downward
then
massive avalanches would thunder into the void
When
the
ceiling
had
retreated upward for some 15 feet in this manner it seemed to stabilize and
thrown rocks had no effect. The two quickly retreated and, with Borden,
who had sat it out in an alcove, left the cave.

Analysis: Rockfall is especially dangerous in unexplored caves, perhaps,
but can occur anywhere. Instabilities can often be seen. At any rate, don't
think it can't happen!
Accident: Canada, British Columbia, Quatsino Master Cave October 1, 1977
On October 1, Lee Sellers, Dalton Pitchford and Martin Davis (20) visited
Quatsino Master Cave, a resurgence cave on Vancouver Island. At 3 p.m. they
entered and proceeded up a succession of short climbs (some close to freezing
waterfalls), fissure traverses and flowstone ledges. One pool is traversed by SW-
inging on a fixed rope. Another, called the Nasty Pool, is passed by a tricky
leap. Sellers and Pitchford made it but when Davis leaped with a hand assist
from Pitchford, he fell short. As he fell backwards Pitchford pulled too hard
A34
and Davis' arm was dislocated at the shoulder. Even so, he made the other
side where the efforts of the other two did not improve his painful, useless
arm. In fact it was soon discovered that Davis would have to use his good
arm to hold the injured one in a horizontal position-the only way the pain
would be lessened. Also, he could only move a few feet at a time before
needing to stop to alleviate the pain. Time thus became a factor since their
electric lights were not fully charged and they were not wearing wet suits
and their clothes were already fairly wet.
Pitchford went to the next drop and retrieved a length of goldline rope.
This they tied around Davis so that Pitchford could lower him down drops
while Sellers aided from below. It was soon found that the victim had to be
lowered in this fashion down even the simplest pitches. On one drop he had
to be lowered through a waterfall and into the plunge pool. Davis became
quite cold and began shivering uncontrollably. A few more difficulties
however, and they reached the entrance.
The group had been in the cave 5 hours and night had fallen. Sellers and
Davis walked straight down hill to some old logging roads where they could
be picked up and Pitchford crossed a treacherous ravine to the vehicle to
proceed to town to get a 4-wheel drive with which to make the pick-up.
Once this was done they proceeded to town to get medical aid only to find
they would have to drive another 50 miles to Campbell River. It was 10
hours after the accident before the injury was treated.

Analysis: Davis cites the following considerations as contributing to the
difficulty of the situation: lack of backup lights, lack of wetsuits, lack of
pain killers and starting late in the day. In short, they were very lucky the
victim was not totally immobilized. A fatality from hypothermia would
surely have resulted.
Accident: Maryland, Twigg's Cave


********** October 14, 1977
Jim Wright, Jr. (19) and Steven Earnst entered Twigg's Cave in
Alleghany County, Maryland at about 8 p.m. on Friday, October 14.
Reportedly, both were experienced cavers. They explored to a point some
850 feet horizontally and 300 feet vertically from the entrance. This includ-
ed roped drops of 25 and 40 feet. The cave is made difficult by its
voluminous, slimy mud.
Wright then pushed a very tight crawlway to the lip of a narrow, keyhole-
shaped, vertical fissure. This was rigged and Wright descended the short
drop to a small room. On attempting to ascend, using Jumars, he found he
was too tired to negotiate the lip of the drop and make the tricky move to
force himself into the crawlway. This fatigue was certainly due at least in
part to bad air in the cave which was to plague rescuers later. Shortly after
midnight Earnst went for help.
They had entered the cave without permission so Earnst drove 14 miles
to phone rather than go to the closest house. The State Police were called
and began operations at 2 a.m. Saturday. Calls went out to various
A35

---------- Page 21 ----------
groups-CRCN, ASRC, Pittsburgh Grotto and Mountain State Grotto.
Before dawn two cavers arrived and checked on Wright's condition-he
was still standing in Jumars at the top of the drop.
In the morning, as rescuers arrived the bad air was considered and a call
went out for an air compressor and electric head lamps. The 40 foot pit was
rigged with a cable ladder and for hoisting. Field telephone lines were run
to the 40 foot pit. The victim was revived with bottled oxygen and lowered
to the floor of the room he was in.
Saturday afternoon the air compressor arrived and was set up with 1000
feet of one inch hose run to the accident site. Rescuers worked in shifts of 4
to 6 hours. Between 3 and 6 p.m. a thin caver was able to give Wright a
drink of water. Between 10 p.m. and midnight two cavers talked Wright
out of his Jumars and got him to tie in to the hoisting line with a chest loop.
At around 4:30 a.m. Sunday, the smallest caver available got to the lip of
the drop and gave Wright some hot chocolate. He was then aided in tying a
foot loop. A hoist was attempted and failed. This exhausted the hoist team
and a fresh team was sent it. The victim was raised over the lip at about
9:30 a.m. He was hoisted up the 40 feet and made his way out, with
assistance from there. He reached the surface at 11 a.m.

Analysis: The bad air in the cave was undoubtedly the real cause of this en-
trapment. But explorers need to remember that it is relatively easy to slip
down into something it may be nearly impossible to get out of. The rescue
was greatly hampered by the bad air and the restricted passage beyond
which the victim was situated.
Accident: Tennessee, Twin Airplane Cave (Tiftonia Pit) October 17 1977
At
about 4:30 on Monday, October 17, Ricky Kates (15), George
Hackler (16), David Hammonds (15) and two companions went caving on
Elder Mountain near Tiftonia, Tennessee. At Twin Airplane Cave they tied
a rope to a tree and Kates, Hackler and Hammonds descended, hand over
hand for about 80 feet to a ledge above a deeper drop.
After some time they tried to ascend but were afraid of a fall down the
drop below and yelled for help. The two on the surface tried to pull them
up without success and then went for help. The Hamilton County Rescue
Squad was called and several units soon arrived. In the course of two hours
additional ropes were rigged and two men descended. Harnesses and cables
were attached to the victims and they were hoisted out.

Times Oct. 18, 1977 p 20.
Analysis: Another example of "non-organized" cavers unaware of current
A36
single rope techniques and utilizing the somewhat out of date hand-over-
hand technique.
Accident: British Columbia, Afternoon Delight Cave November 2, 1977
On Saturday, November 12, a group of five experienced cavers entered
Afternoon Delight Cave on Vancouver Island in British Columbia,
Canada. They soon arrived at an unexplored 30 foot drop. A ladder was
rigged, angling slightly against a boulder wedged in a narrow place about 10
feet below the top. During descent the boulder was checked and found im-
movable.
Four descended with one staying above as belayer. The continuation was
found to be tight and the going was very slow. Tich Morris (35) offered to
trade places with the belayer. At 4:20 p.m. he was ascending when the
boulder, some 80 pounds, fell out of the crack. Morris was looking up and
was struck on the helmet, forehead and the right side of his face. The
helmet was knocked off and Morris called out and came off the ladder, be-
ing held by the belay. He remained conscious, however, and soon con-
tinued his ascent. Bleeding profusely he arrived at the top of the drop. He
"seemed relieved" when the blood was wiped from his eye. The belayer
gave Morris his helmet and at about 4:30 Morris began his way out. When
he reached the entrance at 4:55 the bleeding had stopped. All others were
out by 6:10 and the victim was transported to a hospital where the would
was closed with six stitches.

Accident: Georgia, Ellison's Cave


********** November 25, 1977
A group of 12 cavers from the Windy City Grotto went to Ellison's Cave,
Georgia, on November 25. The cave was experiencing high water at that
time. Two went in the Toroded Entrance and found a waterfall blocking
the way. Another, nearby entrance with a stream running in was possible to
enter without getting completely soaked. The group entered the cave at
1:30 p.m. and proceeded to the 130 foot Warmup Pit where they caught up
with two cavers from a Pittsburgh Grotto group that was ahead of them.
The waterfall at the Warmup was away from the rappel rope but the spray
at the bottom added to their dampness. At the edge of Fantastic Pit (about
510 feet) the two groups, totalling 19 with 17 wanting to do the drop, talked
it over. The Pittsburgh group went first.
The rappels took a very long time. About 200 feet down a waterfall
sprayed the rope with a heavy mist and the rappellers chose to be cautious.
The waterfall also sprayed most of the bottom and the water-generated
breezes whipped the spray around. Everyone huddled in the back of TAG
Hall trying to keep warm and dry. Many used plastic bags as tents with
candles as heaters. One was suffering from cramps from the exertion of
descending. The Pittsburgh group had departed for a tour of the bottom
A37

---------- Page 22 ----------
but the others decided to start out with those waiting taking short tours to
keep warm.
Jim Quade and another ascended first, then Quade left the cave with the
two Pittsburgh cavers waiting at the top. Outside it had turned cold
and one of the Pittsburgh cavers became confused and incoherent on the
way down the mountain. He was guided to the cars and warmed up with
the car heater.
Quade now made a decision-to get help for the rest. He went to nearby
houses and located Smokey Caldwell who dropped his plans and rounded
up some cavers. This group built a fire at the entrance and maintained a
10-hour vigil until all were out. Caldwell entered the cave to assess the
situation.
Meanwhile, the Pittsburgh group had returned and were going out first
because they were suffering more from the cold. They ascended in tandem
but took about two hours per team. Those getting up were sent out to avoid
piling up at the other two drops. Caldwell arrived to lend assistance at the
top of Fantastic Finally all were up and heading out. At the Nuisance drop
one Pittsburgh caver could not continue until given warm food and
clothing. At the Warmup Pit Caldwell attached himself to the rope, this
hypothermic caver attached below and a sling attaching the two. Thus aid-
ed, this near-victim made it out. The last Pittsburgh caver became confused
and had trouble rigging his ascenders. Thirty hours after entering, the last
cavers exited.
Reference: Editorial Windy City Speleonews 18:1 Feb. 1978 p 6-9.
Analysis: Commendable actions by several people kept this from becoming
more serious. Obviously the cave was more suitable for wet-suited cavers
under these conditions. The slowness of one large group, much less two,
made for ideal hypothermic situations. Perhaps both groups needed
stronger leadership and/or the judgement to leave the cave alone under
these conditions. Probably the "prestige" of doing Ellison's clouded their
thinking.
A number of cavers had carbide only and made ascents in the dark. Elec-
tric headlamps should be used on wet drops.
Accident: Kentucky, Sloan's Valley Cave


********** November 26, 1977
On Saturday, November 26, Steve and Eric Kunnemeier and Rick
Scholle (26) entered Sloan's Valley Cave via the Minton Hollow Entrance.
While exploring in the left cave area, Scholle had climbed partway down a
canyon, lost his footing and fallen. He was unhurt, but couldn't find a way
out of the canyon though he felt he could climb out if belayed. Steve went
for help and encountered John Barnes, Phyllis Bradshaw and two other
cavers at the Sloan's Valley fieldhouse at about 2:30 p.m.
Barnes, Bradshaw and Kunnemeier, armed with a 150 foot Bluewater
and vertical gear, entered the cave at 3:04 and a half hour later were at the
canyon. The canyon was 15 feet deep, 16 inches wide for the top 9 feet and
belled out below that. The rope was rigged to a breakdown block in an ad-
jacent room, strung through a crawlway, then down the canyon. A. seat
sling and carabiner were lowered which Scholle, with instruction, was able
A38
to use as a figure-8 seat sling. The belay was tied onto this. The belayer was
anchored to the belay line. The first attempt was unsuccessful so one caver
lowered his lug-soled boots to the trapped caver. By climbing and being
hoisted where there were no holds Scholle then made it up. The group ex-
ited the cave at 4:40 p.m.

Analysis: It is easier to go down than to come up. Fortunately the situation
was such that there were no serious consequences. A short line carried for
belay in situations like this would probably have averted the accident.
Incident: Mexico, Sotano de Huiztmolotitla
December
On Tuesday, December 13, a touring group of cavers did Sotano de
Huiztmolotitla in Mexico. Six cavers entered the cave, doing the 364 foot,
dry, entrance drop and the 156 foot waterfall drop into a long stream
gallery. They did about 3000 feet of the stream gallery and headed out.
Some trouble was encountered at the 156 as the spraying water tended to
put out carbide lamps. Finally, all but Jerry Hassemer (45) were up the 364.
Hassemer rigged in and had just started up when he came out of his chest
harness and fell over backwards to be stopped hanging from his foot loops.
He was using a Mitchell system with a Gibbs safety to a seat sling. His car-
bide lamp was extinguished and so he was hanging a few feet off the floor
in the dark. Communication with those on top was not possible because of
the sound of the waterfall. With great effort Hassemer righted himself and
continued his ascent.
At the top he needed to undo his chest attachment to pass the lip. He
asked for a sling to hold onto and one was provided with a loop quickly
tied on the end. He got out of his box but when he put weight on the hand
sling, the loop came untied and Hassemer again found himself hanging up-
side down, this time at the top of the 364 foot drop. He again righted
himself and with help from the others, passed the lip.

Jim Pisarowicz Personal Communication March 20, 1980.
Analysis: Talk about bad luck! Still, in heavy duty vertical caving, one
should have his system together. By the same token, with a sling loop is of-
fered to one in trouble, it should at least be tied with a real knot.
Incident: Mexico, Sotano de las Golandrinas
December 1977
In the evening of December 16, a 1500 foot length of Bluewater II was
rigged for a descent of el Sotano de las Golandrinas. One caver made the
descent and ascent that evening and noticed nothing unusual. The rope
hung in the pit that night.
At dawn on the 17th the first caver descending noticed nothing unusual.
A39

---------- Page 23 ----------
The second saw a frayed place but continued to the bottom. R. E. Whit-
temore went next with a Bluewater rack with five bars in use. About 50 feet
below the lip he noticed a frayed place coming up. He continued slowly to
inspect it. Besides being frayed it had a blue color in the area of the fray. As
he passed the fray, however, it jammed between the top two bars of the
rack and the sheath separated completely, exposing 8-10 inches of the core.
Whittemore decided to retreat and informed those above he was coming
up. He attached his knee Gibbs but couldn't attach the foot cam, so he call-
ed up to have a portion of the rope not used (the excess beyond the anchor)
lowered. This was done and he transferred to it and ascended.
Reference: Mike Fichesser Personal Communication Feb. 29, 1980.
Analysis: It is apparent that the rope suffered deterioration from a
chemical agent. On this particular trip it was transported with care so can
be presumed to have been slowly deteriorating.
To be watchful is always recommended. Even though others had
descended just before, Whittemore was commendably cautious. Whether a
rope is damaged from abrasion, rock fall or chemicals, hitting the weak
spot slowly rather than fast could be the difference between life and death.
Accident: Missouri, Crevice Cave


********** December 18, 1977
On Sunday, December 18, at about 3 p.m., Dr. Allen Carleson (late 30's)
entered the Echo Pit entrance of Crevice Cave. He rigged the 115 foot shaft
and descended. At the bottom he found the rope a few feet short. When he
dropped off the end, the rope recoiled its stretch leaving the end out of
reach. Carleson sat down to wait.
At 10 a.m. on Monday Carleson was missed when he failed to show up
for surgery. Carleson's associates called local authorities who soon reached
the scene. Meanwhile Mr. Rollets, the landowner, had realized Carleson
was still in the pit and made voice contact. The rope was extended (about
7:30 a.m.) but by that time Carleson was too fatigued to climb out.
The Sheriff's deputies were talked out of descending hand-over-hand by
Mr. Rollets who also got them to contact local cavers.
A team arrived at about noon and rigged the pit. One man descended to
find Carleson unharmed but hungry and shivering uncontrollably. A plan
was conceived and the rescuer ascended. Carleson was then hauled out on
his rope rigged through a pulley on a tractor boom, onlookers supplying
the power. The second rope was used as a belay. Carleson was out at 2:30
p.m.

Analysis: Carleson either forgot about the stretch of the rope or was unable
to stop when he saw the shortness of the rope and switch over to ascent.
Either way, his shortsightedness would have been bad enough on a normal
cave trip, but on a solo effort, it is really inexcusable.

Accident: Oregon, Oregon Caves


********** January 28, 1978
On January 28, Mike Sims (41) and Tim Anderson (36) were in Oregon
Caves, the main cave at Oregon Caves National Monument, on
a
meteorological study project. They were just upstream from the tour
bridge over the River Styx, working to place a chart recorder for monitor-
ing water levels. As always in the winter the cave was very wet, drippy and
muddy. The site is at present the furthest upstream point of penetration
along the River Styx-beyond, the 15 foot high canyon is walled in and fill-
ed for an unknown distance with football-sized rocks deposited in the
1930's when a tunnel to facilitate the tour was blasted nearby.
At 1 p.m., without warning, a number of rocks dislodged and fell, one of
them striking both Sims and Anderson on their left hands. Sims suffered a
bad cut and contusion to the fleshy area between the thumb and forefinger.
The hand was bandaged using supplies from a first-aid kit and the work
continued, the two leaving the cave at 5 p.m.
Reference: Mike Sims "NSS Accident Report Form" Personal
Communication Feb. 1978.
Analysis: Constant water activity had, over the years made the unnatural
fill unstable. A different site should have been chosen.
Accident: Tennessee, Motlow Cave


********** February 22, 1978
On Wednesday, February 22, at about 4 p.m. Randy Speck (18) and Joe
Owens (17) entered Motlow Cave, in Moore County, Tennessee. Both had
explored in this particular cave before. Speck "apparently had begun to
climb up to (a) ledge when a homemade grappling hook snapped. This ap-
parently left him hanging just below the ledge by handholds. He hoisted
himself to the ledge, but was trapped 40 feet up, with no way to descend.
The ledge was a "quarter mile into the cave." Owens went for help.
At about 5 p.m. Owens contacted the Moore County Sheriff's Office.
The Sheriff in turn notified the Tullahoma Rescue Squad and the
Tullahoma Auxiliary Police. At 6 p.m. a rescue squad member and Owens
went into the cave-the other rescuers being "too large." They apparently
talked Speck down and were back out by 8 p.m.

Analysis: The grappling hook should have been made sufficiently strong
for the job plus a wide safety margin and tested before use.
Accident: Illinois, Krueger Dry Run
(Old Schoolhouse) Cave


********** February 26, 1978
Five cavers from St. Louis, Lisa Albrizzi (18), Greg Berry (22), John
Koeckner (18), Tony Nenninger (20) and Mike Thompson (18) entered
Krueger Dry Run Cave near Waterloo, Illinois at 1:30 p.m., Sunday,
A41

---------- Page 24 ----------
February 26. Berry was the only novice in the party; Nenninger was the
only one with experience in that cave.
A short distance into the cave water was encountered and wading was
necessary. The group was headed toward another entrance which would
allow them to exit near their parked vehicle. Once wet, they did not want to
leave by the first entrance to avoid a long walk across frozen fields. Near
their projected exit, however, they reached a place where the 40 degree
water nearly reached the ceiling. The group rested on some rocks and then
turned back. After covering a considerable distance, they found a high
place and huddled together for warmth, awaiting rescue. Hypothermiated,
Nenninger was subject to vomiting. Their carbide lamps and flashlights
were in bad shape. The group waited in darkness. That night the farmer on
whose land they had parked called authorities.
At first rescuers were uncertain which cave to search. On Monday two
dried fruit wrappers were found a short distance inside the entrance of
Krueger Dry Run. These were identified by the wife of one of the cavers.
Four unsuccessful rescue attempts were then made.
The first was made Monday morning but the rescuers gave up after 4
hours due to a lack of wet suits. That evening the O'Fallon, Illinois Under-
water Search and Rescue Team and members of the Waterloo Fire Depart-
ment made attempts but were turned back by the cold water. About mid-
night two cavers from St. Louis, Hank Roth and Kevin Barton who had
mapped the cave, tried, but were also turned back by the cold.
Tuesday morning, Barton and Roth returned with dry suits, accom-
panied by a local caver and four members of the Cahokia Civil Defense
Corps Rescue and Underwater Unit. This group methodically explored the
cave until the lost group was finally encountered. The victims drank some
water, then all headed out. Nenninger was the only one who had to be
evacuated, teams of two rescuers taking turns carrying him. The group ex-
ited the cave about 12:30 p.m. Nenninger's body temperature had dropped
to about 90-91°, a serious hypothermic situation. They had been
underground about 47 hours.

Analysis: The group should have considered the active snowmelt feeding
the water table and either aborted their trip or used wet suits. Plastic bags
or space blankets would have been an obvious asset. They did show the
good sense not to struggle to the end of their strength. According to Dr.
Robert Schettler at St. Clement Hospital, the victims would not likely have
survived another 12 hours. Their only injuries were scraped hands and
knees.
The Sheriff's Office was criticized for not calling cavers sooner. It is ac-
tually the common occurrence for officials to try to "handle" a situation,
A42
even if it is beyond their previous experience, for thus can they broaden
their jurisdiction. It is the cavers' job everywhere to convince local
authorities to call on them when a cave emergency occurs.
Accident: Alabama, Canoe Cave


********** March 16, 1978
On Thursday, March 16, Mark Hajos (16) and Andy Debs entered
Canoe Cave on Huntsville Mountain near Huntsville, Alabama. About 40
feet into the cave Hajos slipped and fell. Hajos was unable to get out so
Debs went for help. Hajos was rescued four hours later by members of the
Madison County Rescue Squad, the Huntsville Fire Department and local
cavers.

Accident: Alabama, 23 Dollar Pit


********** March 19, 1978
On Sunday morning, March 19, Mike Evans, Mike Hackett, and Paul
Locascio entered 23 Dollar Pit on Maxwell Mountain. The cave is a multi-
drop affair. At 2 p.m. the group was at the top of the seventh drop prepar-
ing to descend to the 532 foot level. As Hackett was checking Locascio's
rack, the ledge he was on collapsed and he fell about 24 feet. Locascio rap-
peled down to Hackett and ascertained his injuries. Evans then started out
for help.
At the bottom of the first drop Evans met Bill Torode and Lynny Byrd
and reported Hackett to have a broken arm, dilating pupils and to be losing
consciousness. Torode went down to the victim and the others went for
more help. They exited the cave at 4 p.m., proceeded to the nearest phone,
and called the Huntsville Grotto Rescue Squad. Driving to Eddy Pit #2,
they left a note for a group caving there to come and help. Then they ate
supper.
The group from Eddy Pit #2 arrived at 6:30 p.m. and was sent to get
more of their group from their camp west of Scottsboro.
A short time later the rescue squad arrived and a group carrying four
ropes, medical kit and a stokes litter hiked to the cave entrance at 8:30.
Two, one a paramedic, went into the cave right away to secure the victim's
condition.
Meanwhile, Torode had reached the victim, splinted his arm, and since
he was feeling OK, started him out. He was pulled up the 24 foot drop with
the aid of a rescue pulley. The next drop (6th, 81 feet) was double rigged
with Torode rappelling down to fit Hackett with a Mitchell Box system.
Torode then worked the top Jumar via a sling from the second rope. On the
5th drop a Bilgeri method was used, as in crevasse rescue, where two ropes
are used with a loop tied in the end of each for the victim's feet, one rope at
a time being pulled up. At 10 p.m. they were at the bottom of the 4th drop
(139 feet) where they met the two advance members of the rescue party.
The arm was air splinted and Torode went on out.

---------- Page 25 ----------
The victim proceeded using the Mitchell system with a rescuer working
the upper Jumar from a second rope. Other rescuers double rigged the pits,
then derigged them as the victim made his way up. Hackett was out at mid-
night.

Analysis: Communications in the cave were difficult because of waterfall
noise, but the rescue seems to have proceeded well. The success was aided
by intelligent coordination on the surface.
It is difficult to know if the victim should have foreseen the crumbling of
the ledge. It would be best to be safetied in some way when working around
the lip of a pit.
Incident: West Virginia, Nutt Cave


********** March 25, 1978
On March 25 a group of six to eight cavers led by Bruce Randall entered
Nutt Cave, West Virginia. On the way in they met a group from a college
outing club being led by a couple of NSS cavers. Randall's group proceed-
ed in while the others headed out. About 30 minutes later they reached the
back room. Soon a part of the outing club group arrived thinking they were
headed out. Randall speculates that their leaders had exited the Register
Room (the exit is obscure) with this part of the group not observing the way
and later taking a different route. Randall took them back to the Register
Room, through the proper exit and headed them out.
References: Editor "Trip Reports" York Grotto Newsletter 14:5

Bruce Randall Personal Communication Feb. 26, 1980.
Analysis: This is a minor incident where inexperienced cavers were
separated from their experienced leaders. One could speculate that dif-
ficulties from hypothermia and loss of light could have occurred had Ran-
dall's group not been present.
Incident: Kentucky, Jingle Hole Knob Cave
Spring 1978
Two cavers found a pit on Jingle Hole Knob in the Somerset area of Ken-
tucky in the Spring of 1978. The entrance led to a 12 foot steep slope to the
top of a pit which they plumbed at 55 feet. With no experience in vertical
caving they went home, read McClurg's An Amateur's Guide to Caves and
Caving, bought some rope and gear, practiced and returned to do the pit.
They had 120 feet of 1/2 inch laid poly rope for the rappel-ascent and 120
feet of 1/2 inch manila for belay. Using a Bluewater rack Larry Baldwin
descended. A brief exploration was disappointing, producing no continua-
tion. Baldwin prepared to ascend. Prussik slings were tied and the belay
rope attached. After five steps the stretch in the poly rope was taken up and
the novice began his ascent.
Spinning round and round, he only got up about 40 feet before the belay
A44
rope, slings and mainline were so hopelessly tangled he could move neither
up nor down. He explained to those above but no one could help. In
desperation he saw a thin ledge about eight feet away and swung over to it.
With weight off the rope it still took an hour to get untangled. He then pro-
ceeded up and out.
Reference: Larry Baldwin "First Pit" COG Squeaks 21:6-7
July-Aug. 1978.
Analysis: Sound like your first pit trip? Perhaps this represents the typical
problems of a novice but one can't help think that these problems would be
lessened if organized cavers offered more instruction to the unaffiliated
caver. After all, no instruction book by a vertical caver is available to the
public. What experienced caver would use poly rope, with its low melting
point, for mainline, or use a belay on ascent?
Incident: West Virginia, Sites Cave


********** May 28, 1978
On May 28 a group of six cavers from Ohio was exploring in Sites Cave
near Franklin, West Virginia. In the afternoon they returned to the en-
trance pit to exit the cave. Beside their main and belay lines, a third rope
had been rigged, by a group of three Pennsylvania cavers who were also
now exiting.
Cavers from the two groups ascended at the same time. At one point two
from Ohio, and one Pennsylvania caver, were up, one Pennsylvania caver
was on rope 140 feet up and one Ohio caver was 180 feet up. The remaining
cavers were on the bottom, pressed as closely to the sides of the pit as possi-
ble. An Ohio caver was putting his Gibbs on the rope to be ready to start up
and Charles Short of the Ohio group was talking on a phone they had rigg-
ed to the surface to see if the rope was free.
Suddenly a rock fell from near the top of the pit, whizzed by the Ohio
caver, glanced off the sleeve of the Pennsylvania caver and struck Short
squarely on top of his fiberglass hard hat. The force of the blow caused
Short to bounce off the wall and begin tumbling down the steep incline
away from the site of the rigged lines. He was caught by another caver. Ex-
amination showed no injuries but his hard hat had suffered two 1-inch
cracks on top and been jammed down hard over his forehead, resulting in
temporary loss of vision due to mud and water in the sweatband being forc-
ed into his eyes.
Short felt OK and moved back up to the rope. At this point he began to
shake uncontrollably. The cavers were wet and cold before the incident and
shock had probably reduced his circulation further. Short was therefore
put on the rope next and exited under his own power.
Reference: Charles H. Short "Incident at Sites" COG Squeaks 22:3
March 1979 p 22-24.
Analysis: Short was lucky to have a good hard hat. If possible one should
not be in an exposed place while someone is climbing, ascending or moving
about above. Note that a person can suffer shock even though not injured.

Incident: Kentucky, Sawdust Pit


********** June 10, 1978
Three cavers from the Central Ohio Grotto went to Sawdust Pit, Pulaski
County, Kentucky on June 10. The entrance drop was rigged with six wraps
around a tree with a bowline securing the free end. A figure 8 knot was clip-
ped into a bolt near the breakover and a rope pad tied to the bolt.
After lengthy exploration and mapping they returned and began to as-
cend. The first up found the rope pad loose and retied it. When all were up
the rope was untied and they found it had been chewed by an animal at the
bolt knot, at the portion going to the tree and in five places where it went
around the tree.
Reference: John Barnes "Near Miss in Sawdust Pit" COG Squeaks
Sept. 1978.
Analysis: Even though the rigging was first class, the group was nearly
done in by an animal. Perhaps it would pay to bounce on the rope before
ascending to see if it has been weakened in some manner, like animal gnaw-
ing or rock chopping.
Accident: Indiana, Riverside Cave


********** June 18, 1978
Mike Gunn (27), Glenn Lemasters (25), Lynn Miller (37), Pat O'Connell
(28), Dean Meyer (26) and Larry Wade entered Riverside Cave on Sunday,
June 18. Wade was not equipped with a wetsuit and returned to the en-
trance an hour later and waited. The group proceeded upstream in
a
passage of just walking height. At one point they noticed a high room to
one side. Pushing virgin crawlway with air space down to five inches the
group broke into larger passage and spent several hours exploring.
On their way back out the water crawls, they each got out a waterproof
light source. They got through the worst part, but still had about a thou-
sand feet of 18 inch average height with 2-8 inch water depth to go. While
relighting their carbide lamps they experienced a sudden surge of foamy,
brown water! The passage behind was filled and that ahead was only a few
inches higher. The "room" they were in was only a couple feet higher. The
group fled in panic! Fortunately their wetsuits gave flotation and the force
of the water was with them. They made good time. Near the entrance was a
low place with deep water. This was found to be sumped, with the ceiling at
least a foot below water. In waist-deep, flowing water the group forced
their way upstream to the higher room noticed on the way in. They made it.
In the course of this flight, more than one caver was forced to use water-
proof light sources, cylumes or flashlights, made ready earlier.
Wade exited the cave about 3 p.m. A storm hit shortly afterward, dump-
ing 3-5 inches of rain. He waited for hours, finally became apprehensive,
and walked a mile to a friend's house to make calls to start a rescue. Cavers
around Bloomington were called, and a wetsuit crew of five plus two with
diving gear were raised. They started from Bloomington at 11 p.m. At
12:30 they were at the place where one walks to the cave. The County
Sheriff showed up at that point to investigate the activity, was informed of
the situation and called the State Police for assistance. A group sent to the
cave at 1 a.m. became lost and didn't find the cave. Wildcat Cave was
checked to see if a connection had been made which would have left the lost
A46
cavers at the bottom of the entrance drop of that cave. Another group
checked Riverside Cave and estimated the entrance crawl to be 6 feet under
water. At dawn they returned to Riverside and found the water level had
dropped 4 feet. Rescuers then worked on a breakdown dam to further
lower the water. Soon there was an air space.
Meanwhile in the cave, food and light were pooled and a watch was kept
on the water level. By evening it had started to invade the room and the
group moved into a crevice at the back where there was a dry dirt floor.
Meyer began experiencing chills and was wrapped in a space blanket. By
food was consumed and rest was alternated with walking to keep warm. By
early morning the water began dropping. About 8:30 a.m. it stopped
retreating but was still several inches above normal level. Hearing a ham-
mering sound, Miller and Gumm went downstream to the low, deep water
place, and made voice communication with the rescuers, just outside. They
went back and got the others, passed through a length of 3-inch air space
and were out.

Steve Maegerlein "Riverside Cave" Bloomington, Indiana Grotto
Newsletter 13:4 Aug. 1978 p 79-80.
Analysis: The cavers showed much good sense, which saved them, and
some bad, which nearly killed them. To explore a stream cave with low,
small passages conducting the water and a near sump at the entrance
without assurance of good weather is not good judgement and has killed a
number of cavers-it would have killed these except for the fortuitous high
room. In such a cave one should always look for and note high places, as
these cavers did, before it is needed. Carrying waterproof light sources is a
must and the wetsuits provide more than comfort-they give a big margin
of safety from hypothermia.
Accident: Montana, Silvertip Cave
Summer 1978
During a prolonged expedition to caves on Silvertip Mountain in the
Scapegoat wilderness of Montana, a group was surveying a connection bet-
ween Silvertip and Bell Caves. On the trip out of Bell afterwards they
traversed a wide chimney. Nancy Boice (early 20's) found she couldn't
make the stretch and fell about 25 feet. She was knocked unconscious for a
short time and suffered broken ribs and a bruised knee. After a while she
was able to make her exit, with some assistance from the others.
Reference: Warren Anderson Personal Communication June 1979.
Analysis: Anderson feels they should have known the chimney was too
wide for Boice, and given her a belay. Of course, one should ask for a belay
in such a situation but the group apparently was anxious to proceed rapidly
through the newly discovered easy way out. In such an atmosphere, less
able cavers will try to keep up, moving faster than they should. In this
wildnerness setting, the accident could have had serious consequences if
Boice had been immobilized.

Accident: West Virginia, Canadian Hole


********** July 3, 1978
At 12:30 p.m. on July 3, John Gerber (23) and four companions entered
Canadian Hole in Pocahontas County, West Virginia.
At about 9:30 p.m. the group was exiting the cave and was at the third of
five pits of the entrance series. Gerber went up first. About 30 feet up he
came to a very narrow slot. The rope was rigged with a sling at the top so
that it came down through the widest part of this slot. It is a difficult place.
Gerber was using a two-Jumar "modified Texas" but couldn't quite get his
entire body into the slot. After struggling for 20 minutes he decided to rap-
pel back down. Speaking to those below, he related that he couldn't get his
chest Jumar off and asked for a knife. None was available. He apparently
burned the chest Jumar sling through with his lamp. It was observed that he
dropped a foot or so and was heard to say "I can't breathe!" He struggled
for a minute, then went limp.
As Gerber burned his chest Jumar sling, he dropped due to slack above
his rack. Unfortunately his Joe Brown (Ultimate) helmet caught in the
crack and his chin strap strangled him. After 20 minutes, another caver was
able to ascend and free him from the crevice. He was lowered to the floor
where CPR failed to revive him.
A rescue call went out and a large group of cavers carried out the body
removal. Some difficulty was encountered from the tight, wet vertical
nature of the cave and stiffening of the body from rigor mortis.

Analysis: How many cavers would have been aware of such a possibility?
Obviously a chin-cup strap arrangement rather than the more common
under-the-chin type would have prevented this fatality.
Incident: Tennessee, Stamp's Pit
July 1978
During a Southeast Regional Association Weekend a number of cavers
visited Stamp's Pit in Tennessee, a nice 192 foot freefall drop. The pit is
hazardous however, due to a great deal of loose rock around the upper
edge. One group arrived to find another already descending the pit. The
first group was allowed to complete their descent and leave the bottom of
the pit to explore before the second began their descent. As they descended,
a third group arrived and waited in turn. Soon a fourth group arrived, rig-
ged a second rope and descended. The second and fourth groups were only
doing the pit and began to ascend simultaneously. Meanwhile a fifth group
arrived and rigged a third rope. They received protest from the waiting
third group and encouragement from the fourth group. It wasn't long
before a member of the fifth group began his rappel and a rockfall as well.
Cavers from groups two and four were ascending in tandem so there were
four cavers on rope at the same time. The rockfall included stuff "up to the
size of watermelons" but only one caver was struck, in the back by a
A48
baseball-sized rock. Unbelievably, a second member of group five then
prepared to descend and had to be physically forced by the group there to
wait until the climbers on rope had reached the surface. There was no fur-
ther incident.
Reference: Don Davison "Safety and Techniques" NSS News
April 1979 p 86.
Analysis: Davison points out that "the same activity should be conducted
on each rope simultaneously" so that no one is exposed to someone else's
rockfall. The real point in this incident however, is that if one acts in a suf-
ficiently irresponsible manner, in the face of protest from those en-
dangered, and such act results in a fatality, a court of law could well judge
such to be manslaughter. Think about it.
Accident: Texas, Dead Dog Cave


********** July 5, 1978
At about 7:45 p.m. Wednesday, July 5, four cavers entered Dead Dog
Cave near the Steck Avenue and Balcones Drive intersection in Northwest
Austin. These were Jorg Schwitzgebel (14), Richard (12) and John (14)
Fant, and a fourth caver (25). The cave begins as a 4-foot diameter hole
dropping 20 feet to a room. A short, narrow crawlway descends to more
cave. The fourth caver was left in this room and the others explored fur-
ther. Schwitzgebel had been in the cave three times previously.
At about 8:30 p.m. they were on their way out, with Schwitzgebel in the
lead. As he negotiated the 2-foot wide crawl leading to the entrance room
he was trapped as portions of the crawl suddenly collapsed, pinning his legs
below the hips. The 25-year-old went for help, apparently stopping a truck
driver who dug for a bit at the collapse, then stopped another driver who
called the police on his CB.
A crew of firemen and local cavers dug carefully at the collapse for
hours. Schwitzgebel was freed at 12:30 a.m. Thursday.

Analysis: The cave-in was perhaps due to nearby road construction involv-
ing blasting. The cavers were lucky that no collapse involved their heads as
they were not wearing hard hats.
Accident: Washington, Cave on Cave Ridge


********** July 29, 1978
On July 29, Tim Holland and a companion were exploring in one of the
caves on Cave Ridge above Snoqualomie Pass in Washington. In exiting
the cave Holland was leading. As he was chimneying up a narrow, 20-foot
shaft with loose, rotten rock, he began having light problems. His compa-
nion started to climb up to help when a "sizable" rock was dislodged
above. The rock fell about 10 feet hitting the lower caver on the hand, badly

fracturing a finger. It was not far to the entrance but the victim had to as-
cend a 25-foot roped pitch one-handed and then negotiate a very tight semi-
vertical crevice. The finger was injured further during the exit.

Accident: Florida, Peacock Slew Cave


********** July 30, 1978
On Sunday, July 30, Tim Thomlinson (26), Mike Stephens (21) and Steve
Romero (Marine 1st Lieutenant) were scuba diving in an area called
Peacock Slew in Suwanee County, Florida. They were exploring an under-
water cave and had strung a safety line into it for some 200 feet. Apparently
they had then gone beyond the line, become disoriented in the zero-
visibility, silty water, run out of air, and drowned. The bodies were found
80 feet below the surface, 250 feet into the cave and only 15 feet beyond the
end of their safety line.
Reference: UPI "3 Scuba Divers Drown" The Marietta Daily Journal
Monday, July 31, 1978 p 7-A.
Analysis: Cave Diving is very hazardous and takes special equipment, plan-
ning and training. There is too little info here to determine the exact cause
of this fatality.
Accident: West Virginia, Bowden Cave
September 1978
On Labor Day weekend a group was caving in Bowden Cave, near
Elkins, West Virginia. At about 9:30 p.m. Tom Brooks of the Syracuse
University Outing Club took a 30-foot fall about 2/3 mile from the entrance.
The cave is only 1/2 mile from where an Old Timers Reunion (NSS) was be-
ing held. When Brooks' companions notified the local rescue squad, word
got to the OTR. A crew was dispatched to the cave to verify the report
while others got their gear together. The State Police and a fire department
as well as the rescue squad were involved. Field telephones connected the
entrance with the accident scene. The rescuers were divided into teams
which relayed the victim, warmly covered and strapped to a stretcher. The
victim reached the entrance at 4:30 a.m. He later underwent skull surgery
and has since recovered.

Accident: Texas, Jacob's Well


********** September 2, 1978
On Saturday, September 2, Steve Walker (23) and Richard Taylor were
scuba diving in Jacob's Well, southwest of Austin, Texas. The well is a
water-filled cave, one resurgence for the Edwards Aquifer. It is open for
diving only to licensed divers and Walker, an experienced diver, had ex-
plored in Jacob's Well on previous occasions. Both divers were students at
Houston Baptist University.
The two proceeded to the "Third Chamber", some 110 feet below the
surface where Walker removed his tanks and pushed into a narrow passage.
There he became stuck, perhaps from shifting gravel, and tapped on his
tanks for help. Taylor could not pull him free. He drowned when his air
supply failed.
A volunteer force of divers from Austin, San Marcos and Wimberly
spent nearly 24 hours removing the body.

tion.
Accident: Missouri, Roubidoux (Indian) Cave


********** September 16, 1978
On Saturday afternoon, September 16, three cavers (ages 12 to
entered Roubidoux Cave near Waynesville, Missouri. They were wearing
short-sleeved shirts, pants and tennis shoes and were without hard hats.
After exploring for some time, their flashlights began to fail. As they tried
to find a non-existent back entrance their lights failed entirely. They pro-
ceeded a ways without light but gave it up and huddled together, awaiting
rescue.
That evening they were missed and eventually the Pulaski County Sheriff
was called. Later the boys' bicycles were found at the entrance of the cave.
Some relatives apparently entered and found a flashlight and a picture car-
ried by one of the cavers. Even so, it wasn't certain that the boys were still
in the cave and presumably the search was carried on elsewhere. Finally, at
about 6 p.m. on Tuesday, the MSM Spelunker's Club was called. By 11
p.m., 20 cavers from MSM and SEMO were at the cave. They searched for
some distance into the cave, eventually finding the lost cavers in a small,
low room. They were all cold and the youngest was shivering. They were
given warm clothes, spare lights and food and water. On the way out the
youngest had to be carried for a short distance. The exiting was otherwise
without incident and all were out by 1:30 a.m., Wednesday, after more
than three days in the cave.
Reference: Jerry Wagner "Rescue in Roubidoux" Southeastern Caver
Sept.-Oct. 1978 p 73-74.
Analysis: The length of time before a thorough search of the cave was
undertaken seems excessive and was largely due to the unfamiliarity of the
local authorities with the work of cavers in the area and their rescue
capabilities.
The condition of the boys was good considering the length of their stay
in the cave. They drank cave water with no ill effects. When they stopped,
A51

while attempting to find their way in the dark, they were 200 feet from, and
heading for, a 40-foot pit. Another example of cavers outside the "organiz-
ed" caving community using inadequate equipment.
Accident: New York, Wards-Gregory
(Clarksville) Cave


********** September 23, 1978
In the early afternoon on September 23, five Cornell Grotto members
entered Wards-Gregory Cave in Clarksville, Albany County, New York.
After touring the Wards section, they decided to do a thru-trip, exiting the
Gregory entrance. In the Upper Cook Avenue section, shortly before the
Chutes, they encountered two adults and a ten-year-old. They had earlier
met this group in Perry Ave. of the Wards section. These people had no
head protection, carried only a flashlight apiece plus some candles, and
were wearing blue jeans and windbreakers. By the time of the second en-
counter, these three were all quite cold from wading in the cave stream. The
youngster was shivering. The candles were exhausted and their last working
flashlight was almost dead. They had gone through Brindley's Sump, a
pool, three times trying to find the Gregory Entrance. The youngster was
given an extra wool sweater and the group was led out the Gregory En-
trance.
Reference: John Coraor "Lost Locals Aided in Clarksville Cave"
Dripstone 9:1 Fall 1978 p 7-8.
Analysis: The group was lost due to inadequate sources of light. Even
though they could not find the Gregory Entrance, they still, with adequate
light, could have retraced their steps to the Wards Entrance. Once lost in
total darkness, their inadequate clothing would have led to hypothermia.
The lack of head gear is another obvious deficiency.
Accident: Washington, Dynamited Cave


********** October 7, 1978
At around 4 p.m. on October 7, Steven Brown (28), Thomas Carter and
Terria Caldwell entered Dynamited Cave in Skamania County,
Washington. They went at least past the climable 10-foot drop and the
40-foot pit. On the way out Carter and Caldwell reached the top of the 40.
As Brown ascended he reached the upper, sloping part of the drop and then
fell to the talus pile below.
Caldwell left to notify the Forest Service and Sheriff's Office, while
Carter stayed with the victim. Sheriff's Deputies and an ambulance were
dispatched. Three and a half hours later the victim had been evacuated. His
injuries were later diagnosed as multiple abrasions and tension
pneumothorax.

Accident: Iowa, Skunk Cave


********** October 8, 1978
At around noon on Sunday, October 8, seven students from Grinnell
College entered Skunk Cave, near Kendallville, Iowa. At about 2 p.m. one
of the group, Pete Erspamer (19) was inching along a ledge in a crevice
when he lost his footing and fell seven feet, becoming wedged in a narrower
portion of the crevice. The group did their best to free him but could not
and finally went for help.
Calls went out and many volunteers responded, including fire depart-
ments, Sheriff's deputies, and students from Luther College. The problem
was not a simple one, however, in the restricted confines of the narrow
cave. A block and tackle was tried first but could not be properly set up in
the space available. A porta- power unit proved too big for the crevice. The
victim meanwhile was suffering both mental and physical exhaustion.
Levering the victim out was tried to no avail. Chisel and hammer were
brought in to widen the crack but were not used. A doctor went in and gave
the victim sugar intravenously. Finally Erspamer was freed by moving him
down slightly, then horizontally through the crack with people both
pushing and pulling at either end. At 2 a.m. he was free and at 3 a.m. was
outside being taken to a local hospital. He had suffered no injuries.

Editor "Spelunker Rescued after 12 Hours Trapped in Cave"
Decorah Public Opinion Oct. 10, 1978.
Analysis: The tight crevice-type cave makes a rescue very difficult. Here a
great deal of time and manpower went into what looked like a simple situa-
tion. An experienced cave rescue group would have proved useful.
Accident: Georgia, Johnson's Crook Cave


********** October 15, 1978
On Sunday, October 15, Gary Moss and Dick Sears visited Johnson's
Crook Cave north of Huntsville, Alabama. They found the narrow,
twisting, 20-foot entrance drop rigged with two cable ladders, two
Bluewater ropes and a ragged, rotten, knotted hemp rope. Rigging their
own Bluewater, they entered. They soon encountered the two kids who had
rigged the hemp rope and joined up for a few hours exploration. When
they decided to leave, they found all other groups gone. The kids insisted
on using their rope but evidently had not actually tried their method.
Hand-over-hand, neither could get up more than 10 feet. With the novices
borrowing some vertical gear and receiving some instruction, all four made
it out by nightfall.
Reference: Dick Sears "Johnson's Crook Cave, Georgia" Huntsville
Grotto Newsletter 20:4 p 37.
Analysis: If the two novices had been alone, they would have been trapped.
The difference in technique, in this example and others, between cavers in
contact with the "organized" caving scene and those entirely self-
motivated and out of touch with that scene is amazing.

Accident: New Mexico, Hell's Below Cave


********** November 11, 1978
On November 11 a group of nine cavers were in Hell's Below Cave, Eddy
County, New Mexico. Following others, Carol Belski (33) was ascending a
75-foot pit on 7/16 Goldline. She was using a rope-walker system, with
Gibbs ascenders rigged to knee and foot and a Mother Lode (imitation
Jumar) ascender rigged to a chest sling as a third point of attachment.
About 60 feet up her knee-Gibbs sling failed at the sewn joint. As she lur-
ched to one side the Mother Lode turned and the rope twisted out. For-
tunately her foot-Gibbs harness held, leaving her hanging by one foot!
Mark Wetherald quickly ascended and secured her to the rope with a
Jumar which he attached to her chest sling.
Meanwhile an additional rope was rigged and Dave Belski descended to
the victim. He attached himself to the original rope with two foot-rigged
Jumars while the victim was secured to his seat harness. Her foot harness
was then cut and she resumed an upright posture, hanging from D. Belski's
seat sling. Wetherald then ascended a bit further and cut the Jumar slings
attaching D. Belski to the original rope. The Belskis then rappelled as one
to the bottom. C. Belski was inverted for 45 minutes and on rope for an
hour. Muscle pulls and soreness were the only bad results. Total time in the
cave was 5-6 hours.
References: Dave Belski "Accident" Personal Communication
Dec. 1978.
Carol Belski Personal Communication March 11, 1980.
Analysis: The harnesses were made of one inch tubular nylon webbing and
sewn with "Dual-duty polyester" cotton thread. This is really just cotton
thread and should never be used for sewing vertical gear. The name is
deceptive. Use only heavy, pure-synthetic thread.
The Mother Lode ascender is a copy of the Jumar, produced in Califor-
nia until Jumar threatened suit for copyright infringement. They are fairly
widely used and seem to be dependable. In this case the Mother Lode
twisted off the rope because the safety gate spring broke. This can happen
to Jumars also.
Accident: Kentucky, Cool Springs Cave


********** November 19, 1978
On Sunday afternoon, November 19, Tim Robinson (17) and Wesley
Allen (17) went exploring in Cool Springs Cave in Trigg County, Kentucky.
In mid-afternoon their single flashlight failed. With no obvious way out,
they elected to wait for help. That evening they were reported overdue to
the State Police and about midnight a search in the cave was begun. They
were found, safe, about one and a half hours later, having spent 13 hours in
the cave.

scene using a "classic" approach to exploration-get a light and go for it.

Accident: Kentucky, Sloan's Valley Cave


********** November 24, 1978
A group of six cavers entered Sloan's Valley Cave in Pulaski County,
Kentucky via the Minton Hollow Entrance at 11:30 a.m. on Friday,
November 24. For three members it was only their second cave trip. For
that reason they had planned a trip of about seven hours through relatively
easy walking or stooping passages to the White Grotto beyond the Minton
Big Passage.
After seeing the White Grotto the group was heading out taking a slight-
ly different route than the one taken it. This route led over huge breakdown
blocks forming a high, long ridge through a passage 50 feet in diameter.
The leader stopped to help others get up a high spot on the ridge. Kathy
Green (32) was first and as the leader helped the next, she continued.
Though the ridge is flat and several feet wide at that point, she apparently
lost her balance. She screamed and the leader turned to see her go over the
edge, falling about 20 feet onto breakdown.
The leader, Dennis Green, climbed down to find the victim wedged be-
tween two slabs of breakdown. She was unconscious, bleeding from the
mouth and her face and neck were puffy. She was checked for fractures
and then lifted from her wedged position and laid on a flat rock. She
became conscious, but was in shock. She was made as warm as possible. It
appeared her injuries were confined to her head and one wrist. The situa-
tion was complicated in that Dennis Green was the only one knowledgable
in first-aid and also the only one who definitely knew the route to the en-
trance.
Green and one other went for help. They made it to the entrance in about
an hour despite losing their way at one point. His companion was left at a
road junction to wait for one of their party who had not gone into the cave
and Green drove on to the field house. Two cavers were there, so they got
gear and medical supplies and headed back to the cave. A map of the cave
showing the site of the accident was left with the landowner. Meanwhile,
Green's companion had stopped someone with a CB radio who had called
the Sheriff's Office.
The rescuers entered the cave at 9 p.m. and reached the victim at 10 p.m.
Kathy Green had improved and was able to walk. She required assistance
over breakdown and was not able to wear her helmet because of her head
and facial injuries. She exited the cave at about 12:45 a.m.
Meanwhile, Sheriff's deputies and the Pulaski County Rescue Squad had
arrived and tried to go to the victim in the cave, spending two fruitless
hours searching.
The victim's injuries were diagnosed as multiple fractures of the jaw and
cheekbone, a severely sprained wrist, a concussion, and multiple contu-
sions on the right side of her back and body.
References: Editor "Rescue in Minton Hollow Cave" The Cave
Cricket Gazette Jan. 1979.
Dennis Green Personal Report undated.
Analysis: The accident was apparently due to stumbling or vertigo in a
situation where even a very cautious caver would not belay.
The cavers criticized the Sheriff's Office for threatening to arrest them
for committing a rescue without permission. The Sheriff's Office was ac-
tually within reason. One is not supposed to partake in rescue of a reported
A55

---------- Page 31 ----------
accident victim without the permission of the County Sheriff. This liaison
is a problem for rescue groups everywhere. It is the cavers' job to properly
establish their rescue capability with every County Sheriff in cave country
so that they will be utilized when an accident occurs.
Accident: Alabama, Natural Well


********** November 24, 1978
One November 24, Ker Varnadoe, Mark La Roche (15) and Ray Kenler
visited Natural Well in Madison County in Alabama. All three rappelled
the 185-foot entrance drop and explored the cave. In exiting, Kenler
ascended the 185. La Roche came next using a Mitchell System but panick-
ed about 15 feet off the floor and refused to continue. He was talked back
down by Varnadoe but could not be talked into ascending. Varnadoe
ascended and at 6:35 p.m. called for help. Kenler rappelled back down to
keep the victim company. The Huntsville Grotto Rescue Squad and
Madison County Rescue Squad soon supplied eight rescuers. A second
rope was rigged and a mechanical advantage pulley system had the victim
out by 8:30 p.m.
Reference: Bill Varnadoe "Natural Well Rescue" Huntsville
Grotto Newsletter 20:1 Jan. 1979 p 4.
Analysis: Varnadoe says the cavers had done several 100 foot pits and 70
foot cliffs previously. This is apparently a case of a caver not being
psychologically "up" for such a pit on that particular day. We all have
mental "ups" and "downs" and one should try to know oneself enough to
recognize when one is "down."
Accident: Mexico, Cueva del Brinco


********** December 1, 1978
On Friday, December 1, at 11 a.m. a group of cavers entered Cueva del
Brinco on the highlands west of Victoria in the state of Tamaulipas, Mex-
ico. They were Chris Kerr (22), Hal Lloyd, Jim Smith and Steve Zeman.
They intended to push upper leads in the Valhalla section. Traversing the
Historic Section, they ascended the Chute, passed the Laguna Verde
Cutoff, climbed up to the Helictite Room and on up the wet and arduous
Tin Can Alley, through several tight places, including Argonaut Crawl.
Beyond this is Valhalla.
In the first part of Valhalla, the floor is covered with breakdown. After
120 feet one encounters an unclimable dropoff covered with unstable,
muddy breakdown. Backtracking about 100 feet allows one to bypass this
drop via a fissure. The group missed this bypass. Kerr arrived first, then
Smith. Kerr saw tracks going down around a breakdown block and tried to
follow them. At the block it got very vertical and he turned to face the
slope. As he reached around the block to get a handhold, he lost his footing
and fell, hitting his chin on the lip, knocking off his helmet and light. He
screamed. It was 1:30 p.m.
The others rushed to the edge of the pit; luckily he had only fallen 20 feet
but still had, apparently, suffered a disabling injury-broken leg or ankle.
It took 10 minutes to find the bypass and get to Kerr. They decided he had
A56
a broken left femur, ankle injury and possible broken ribs. A space blanket
was gotten out and wrapped around the victim and carbide lamps were
placed under it for warmth.
At 3 p.m. Lloyd and Smith left for the surface to get help. There were no
other cavers in the area at that time but Smith wrote, in English and
Spanish, a basic rescue message and gave it to a local resident, Antonio
Ledezma, to take to Victoria, 6 to 8 hours away, where a call could be
made to Texas for additional manpower. Smith and Lloyd, armed with
first-aid material (pack frame, food, stove, water, warm clothes, sleeping
bags and aspirin) returned to the accident site. A note was left on the
fieldhouse door. Operations were begun to move Kerr out of the cave. By 3
a.m. he had been gotten up the drop. This exhausted the three rescuers and
caused Kerr much pain. It was decided to bivouac. Zeman and Lloyd made
a 4-hour round trip to the Dressing Room to get some of the first-aid gear
they had stashed there. Kerr was then placed in a sleeping bag with wet suits
under him. Smith prepared food and then he and Kerr slept; Zeman and
Lloyd left the cave.
At 3 a.m. Ledezma arrived at Victoria to find the telephone office closed
until 7 a.m. At that time he got through to Bill Stone in Austin. The basic
situation was conveyed but the victim was wrongly interpreted as Jim
Smith. Calls were made and rescuers made ready in Austin and McAllen. A
call to the National Cave Rescue Commission for possible medical support
produced instead international diplomatic activity and Air Force participa-
tion. Two trucks of rescuers from the Rio Grande Valley and one from
Austin were flown to Victoria, in Mexico, on C-130's saving hours of travel
time. By midnight on Saturday the three trucks were at the fieldhouse, fin-
ding Zeman and Smith asleep. It was decided to start operations in the
morning. Meanwhile a group reconnoitered an entrance unknown to the
accident caving party, the Entrada de Vapor, less than 300 feet from the
Argonaut in Tin Can Alley. The report was favorable.
Early the next morning Art Centeno (medical student) and Tracy
Johnson (nurse) proceeded to the victim and other teams went in to enlarge
passage. A great deal of effort was expended in that direction, using sledge
hammers and blasting.
At 8 p.m. (Sunday) the move was begun with Kerr strapped in a Robert-
son litter and six cavers as bearers. In some places only two people could
handle it at a time and on occasion a rope was rigged to support it while it
was guided along. In several tight places Kerr was obliged to pull himself
along. At 2 a.m. he was hauled up the 25-foot entrance pit and carried to
the fieldhouse. At 10:30 Monday morning Kerr was trucked down the
mountain, across the border and arrived at McAllen General Hospital at
midnight, where he was treated.

Lucius Lomax "Austin Cave Experts Rush to Rescue Injured Explorers"
Austin American-Statesman Dec. 3, 1978.
Analysis: This rescue is a fine example of competent cavers, each assuming
an appropriate role, working together to reach the common goal, the ex-
traction of the victim. Leadership was by suggestion and example-there
was no rigid structure to the rescue groups. The accident itself seems
avoidable, however, and such things should not happen to competent
cavers. Kerr was lucky he was not critically injured and that there was an
entrance nearby. When climbing one should be able to assess a situation
and have reasonable assurance that one can do it, if it is to be done without
a belay.
Kerr's helmet came off in the fall and this could have cost him his life. A
helmet should have a chin strap that does not allow this to happen.
Accident: Vermont, Morris Cave


********** December 6, 1978
At 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday, December 6, Charles Cranian (43), a
teacher, entered a cave near Route 7 near Danby, Vermont in the company
of another teacher-and several boys from the school. Some distance into
the cave Cranian announced he "wasn't having fun" and started out. The
rest continued for a short distance and then started out also. They soon en-
countered Cranian, lying down and gasping for breath. They couldn't
move him and so left the cave for help.
The first rescuers on the scene were two locals who entered the cave at
4:30 p.m. and found the victim some 200 feet from the entrance, "lying on
his back screaming for help." The two got one in front and one behind and
began dragging the man toward the entrance. This proved too dificult in
the narrow, twisting cave and they went to the entrance and got a rope and
two members of the Manchester Rescue Squad. The four then returned to
the victim and used a rope arrangement to maneuver him through tight and
difficult places. Meanwhile the victim "kept moaning and yelling that he
was in shock." At 9:15 they emerged from the cave, with the victim semi-
conscious and talking weakly. At a hospital he was found to be unhurt.

Analysis: This appears to be a simple case of claustrophobia. I believe that
many people have a potential for this and that one result is the relative un-
popularity of caving as a sport. Certainly anyone with a dislike for closed
spaces should not be talked into caving or he could end up as a basket case
like this one.
Accident: Alabama, Un-named Pit


********** December 27, 1978
M. O. Smith (36) and R. W. Schreiber were checking pits in Vaught
Cove, Jackson County, Alabama, on December 27. They had just done a
35-foot un-named pit and were coiling the rope when Smith realized his
glasses had been left below. Instructing Schreiber to carry on, Smith re-

A little later Schreiber returned, lowered the rope and

some effects from the fall and the following day X-rays
pressed vertebrae and a backbrace was applied.

Accident: Georgia, Anderson Spring Cave


********** March 3, 1979
On Saturday morning at 11:30 a group of 11 cavers entered Anderson
Spring Cave on Pigeon Mountain near LaFayette, Georgia. These were stu-
dent members of the Outdoor Club of Georgia Southwestern College, their
leader Barry Beck (40), an assistant professor of geology, and Beck's son,
Eric (13). The students, all in their late teens, included Cheryl Gillis, Tony
Able, Mark McKoy, Tony Johnson, Mary Faye Smith, Warren Moore,
Dennis Hudgins, Louis Pounds and Steen Madsen. Beck and his son are ex-
perienced cavers, the rest were not. All were well-equipped with hard hats,
spare lights, warm clothes and a lunch.
At between 3 and 3:30 they neared the end of the large effluent stream
passage, nearly a mile from the entrance. Lunch was eaten and Johnson,
having lamp trouble, and Eric Beck, getting cold, decided to leave. The
other nine continued to a breakdown choke and unsuccessfully explored it
for an hour. At this point they decided to leave the cave.
Meanwhile, outside, a thunderstorm described by some as the worst in
decades struck the southeast. Up to 15 inches of rain fell in some areas.
Torrents of rain descended on Pigeon Mountain.
As the cavers headed for the entrance the rising water was noticeable.
Former drips from the ceiling were now gushing water. In the large passage
the rising cave stream meant little, but the entrance area is constricted, so
they hurried on. To their dismay they found the entrance passage nearly
filled with water. Two students, McKoy and Able, wanted to push on out
and received Beck's permission. Fortunately the passage had not quite
sumped and they exited successfully. The rest retreated upstream and
climbed breakdown to an upper level to wait out the flood. They were wet
to the neck but huddled together to stay warm and also exercised every
hour. After 8 to 10 hours their clothing dried and their stay became quite
tolerable.
In the meantime the four who had left contacted the Walker County
Civil Defense. Other agencies were alerted, and late Saturday an attempt
was made to enter the cave but the force of water flowing out made this im-
possible. Sunday morning, four scuba divers from the Walker County Cave
Rescue Squad were also beaten back by the water flow just inside the en-
trance. The National Cave Rescue Commission coordinated the flying in by
the Air Force of a special hypothermia treatment team from Virginia. At
around 7 p.m. on Sunday two divers struggled through a 60-foot near-
sump with a strong current of 45 degree water. When they entered the large
passage they found the cavers already prepared for an attempt at leaving.
Using an extra regulator on one of the scuba tanks, the trapped cavers were
escorted one-by-one through the 4-inch air space of the near-sump. The last
person was out 33 hours after entering. The cavers were checked at a near-
by hospital and found to be in good condition.

Analysis: Entering the cave in the face of bad weather is perhaps excusable
in this case since the leader was familiar with the cave and knew that even
heavy ordinary rain would not close it. However, when the entrance was
found to be nearly sumped when they first went to leave, no one should
have been allowed to make the attempt to get out. If the low air space had
gotten lower as Able and McKoy proceeded they might have panicked and
drowned in an attempt to force their way. Better for all to wait it out.
Accident: Tennessee, Sinking Cove Cave


********** March 3, 1979
At 10:15 on Saturday, March 3, Rick Buice (31), Will Chamberlain (26),
Elizabeth Ferguson (38) and Tom Selmon (22) entered Sinking Cove Cave
in Franklin County, Tennessee. Depending upon susceptibility to cold they
were wearing from shorty to full wetsuits. Sinking Cove is a resurgent
stream cave and they planned on doing some surveying. They pushed
upstream, mapping side leads. One lead broke into big passage and they
surveyed about 800 feet. When they tired, they started out.
They reached the main stream to find it beginning to get muddy and ris-
ing. Making their way with some difficulty they reached the first room,
some 300 feet inside the entrance. They went for it, with Chamberlain in
the lead. As he neared the entrance he had to fight to keep from being
swept away. Ahead he could see an air space of only three inches high and
ten inches wide and a raging current below it. He retreated and at 6 p.m.
the group decided to sit it out.
Outside, the same storm that was the cause of the contemporaneous
Anderson Springs Cave entrapment had struck. Three friends who had
gone ridgewalking took notice and began a wait outside the cave. Ex-
plosives were obtained to modify the entrance to allow it to drain more
quickly, but were not used.
The trapped cavers retreated to the first room and began a watch on the
water level with occasional exercise to keep warm. After six hours, the
water began to rise again, gaining four to six feet in height in two hours. At
a.m. Sunday the group retreated to a higher place a bit upstream. Time
passed slowly.
At 10 a.m. the water had dropped over a foot and they moved back to
their first sanctuary. More waiting. At 7:30 p.m. Sunday the water seemed
well down so they headed out. Where they had turned back before was now
12 to 14 inches of air space. They emerged around 9:30 p.m., having been
in the cave some 34 hours.

---------- Page 34 ----------
Analysis: The heaviness of the rain was extremely unusual. A normal rain-
fall probably would not have affected the cavers. In general, however, one
should consult and heed weather forecasts when planning a trip to a cave
even possibly affected by rain.
Incident: New Mexico, Hidden Cave
Easter Weekend 1979
Paul Simmons, Ed LaRock and others were caving in the Guadalupe
Mountains of New Mexico where they visited Cottonwood and Hidden
Caves. At Hidden Cave they encountered four cavers, two male and two
female. These four were doing the 50-foot entrance pit. One fellow ap-
parently experienced as a rock climber rappelled in, followed by the two
girls. The last fellow "stumbled around" for some ten minutes and manag-
ed to get the rope clipped through one brake bar of his rig. "With Gibbs
hanging by slings from both arms, seat harness around his knees, one hand
grasping the rope above the rappel gear and the other clutching his battery
pack, he asked for a bottom belay" and made to rappel. Simmons and
LaRock grabbed his seat harness and told him to at least fix that and to
hold the rope below the rappel device. Rearranging things, he still only held
the rope below the 'biner "with his little finger while still holding the bat-
tery pack. Simmons and LaRock convinced him not to descend. His com-
panions had to be directed out of the cave by other cavers. They later ex-
plained that he had just drunk a pint of whiskey.
Reference: Ed LaRock "Easter in the Guads" Caving in the Rockies 22:4
July 1979 p 3-4.
Analysis: Obviously drinking and caving don't mix. Simmons and LaRock
did well to turn off an accident in the process of occurring.
Accident: Virginia, Pig Hole Cave


********** March 10, 1979
Three cavers, Mark Emerson, Jay Kennedy (18), and Mark Neas, rap-
pelled into the 120 foot pit entrance of Pig Hole Cave, Giles County,
Virginia on March 10, at about 10 a.m. An hour's travel took them to the
Empire Ledge drop (170 feet). This was rigged and Kennedy rappelled to
the bottom, Hess' Hollow. Emerson descended next to a ledge halfway
down in order to rig ladders down a bypass drop to the Hollow to
"alleviate rub points on the rope." Neas then rappelled into the Hollow.
Neas and Kennedy traversed a tight crawlway to the ladder drop just rigg-
ed. To reach the ladder drop it was necessary to cross a 15-foot pit. Neas
crossed and climbed the ladder preparing to belay Kennedy. Kennedy ex-
perienced difficulty with the pit and decided to try to descend the pit and
climb up the other side. He found a route leading beneath a large slab of
breakdown. At that point his carbide lamp began to go out so he hurried
under the slab to where he could hug a smaller rock to reach a foothold. As
he hung over the edge hugging the rock, it moved, threatening to trap him
beneath the large slab which it supported. He panicked and let go and fell
six feet to the bottom of the pit. As he fell he lacerated his wrist and bruised
his arm and left knee. He shouted that he was OK. Emerson descended the
A62
pit and both climbed out. After a rest, Kennedy was able to exit the cave
unassisted.
Reference: Jay Kennedy Accident/Incident Report, Pig Hole Cave,
Virginia 1979.
Analysis: Kennedy reports that he got off easy-his thick clothing took
most of the laceration and he missed a sharp-edged block of breakdown by
only a foot when he landed. He also feels he should have (1) had Emerson
wait for him and rig a handline, (2) carried a second light source, and (3)
not relied on one hand-hold.
This party was obviously of unequal abilities. The more experienced
should look out for others. All too often it is the novice or least experienced
caver who gets into trouble.
Accident: Indiana, Buckner's Cave


********** March 24, 1979
In the evening of March 24, 1979, Sandy Ead (19), Greg Combs (23) and
Rod Evans entered Buckner's Cave near Bloomington, Indiana. They were
not experienced cavers but planned to stay overnight in the cave and were
presumably burdened with sleeping gear and food. They were not wearing
hard hats.
The cavers proceeded past the T Room to the Big Room. In that area,
Ead lost her footing and fell about ten feet, striking her head on the wall. It
WS 9:30 p.m. She was unconscious for about one minute and began
bleeding from the side of her head just above the left ear. The wound was
closed with a pressure dressing made from a shirt, but the bleeding con-
tinued. They started out of the cave.
In the crawlway Combs struck his forehead on the ceiling and suffered
a
scalp cut which began to bleed. They kept going. Near the entrance they
met a group of cavers checking leads. One of these, an Emergency Medical
Technician, examined the victims, treated Combs, and the combined group
left the cave. The injuries were later diagnosed as laceration, shock and
concussion for Ead and laceration and contusion for Combs.
References: Will Ott "Accident Report - Buckner Cave" Personal
Communication 1979.
Richard Blenz Personal Communication February 18, 1980.
Analysis: What caver exposed to the organized caving scene would enter a
cave without a hard hat? The money spent for one visit to the doctor for a
scalp laceration would buy the finest helmet made. The root cause of this
accident is probably some degree of alcoholic intoxication. The victims
reportedly had been drinking.
Accident: California, Soldier's Cave


********** March 31, 1979
On March 31 a group of cavers entered Soldier's Cave in the Sierra
Nevada foothills of Tulare County, California. In the early evening they
had reached the Ladder Room. As they were exploring, the floor suddenly
gave way beneath John Potter (30) and he fell about 15 feet. He suffered
A63

---------- Page 35 ----------
leg and hip injuries and was unable to proceed. A party member was dispat-
ched to summon help.
At 11 p.m. the National Park Service was notified and Larry Brown,
Paul Fodor and four other personnel were dispatched from Ash Mountain
Station. They arrived and began rigging the cave for the evacuation. Fodor
descended the 60-foot drop to assess injuries and direct the rescue from
that point. Brown was stationed above the 60 and the other four rangers
were scattered through the upper part of the cave. The two uninjured
cavers remained with the victim.
The injuries were assessed as badly bruised hip and thigh and a possible
broken ankle. The evacuation began at 3 a.m. and ended at 9:15 a.m. when
the victim was placed in his car for transport to a hospital.
Reference: Editor "Accident in Soldier's Cave" The Explorer May 1979
p 76.
Analysis: Although Potter had been in the cave before, he was unaware
that the floor of boulders and small cobbles across which he was walking
was a false floor only 10-12 inches thick. An accident like this is probably
unavoidable.
Accident: Arizona, Pit near Lyman State Park
May or June 1979
In early summer of 1979, novice caver Lyle Dimbatt and companions
were attempting to explore a 70-foot pit near Lyman State Park in Apache
County, Arizona. The descent was made. As Dimbatt was being hoisted out
via a rope attached to a car, the system failed. Either the rope abraided and
broke or a knot came apart. He fell about 60 feet, suffering severe injuries.
These included spinal injuries and the victim may be permanently paralyz-
ed.
Reference: Arlin Pound Personal Communication Feb. 28, 1980.
Analysis: This appears to be yet another case of a caver out of touch with
the organized caving scene and current vertical techniques.
Incident: Kentucky, Un-named Cave


********** May 5, 1979
Five cavers were exploring a new cave in Dry Valley in Wayne County,
Kentucky. Digging open the entrance, it was found to lead quickly to a
50-foot drop where a cable ladder was rigged but no belay was used. The
cave at the bottom soon ended and the cavers started to leave. Dean Red-
shaw (55) became arm weary a little over halfway up the pit. He began
backing down but lost his hold completely when a foot slipped. He slowed
his descent somewhat by pressing in on the sides of the ladder with his
hands. He landed on small breakdown, severely bruising his left foot, but
luckily was otherwise unhurt. He rested and then was belayed up the drop.

A64
Analysis: Cable ladders are deceptive. They look easy but in fact are more
tiring than a properly set up SRT rig. Moreover, people tend to use them
without belay, and in this near-accident. Also, visual inspection will not
reveal the strength of a ladder.
Incident: Missouri, Hamilton Cave


********** May 20, 1979
On May 20, a group of cavers visited Hamilton Cave in Washington
County, Missouri. Included were Chuck Malone, Rose Malone, Scott
Guyer, Larry Zykan and Bob Ronecker, all in their late twenties. All were
experienced cavers with Chuck Malone the assigned leader. They proceed-
ed along 2,000 feet of large stream passage to a 500-foot crawl leading to
more large passage and a waterfall. The weather outside was cloudy and all
were aware of and on the lookout for signs of rising water.
Zykan, C. Malone and Ronecker negotiated a very tight place about 100
feet into the crawl and were waiting for the others. Suddenly there was a
commotion and R. Malone yelled to the waiting group that they should
leave the cave immediately. It sounded serious and all began, rather fran-
tically, to head out. The three behind quickly realized that the problem was
not rising water, as they first suspected, but a choking, noxious odor that
soon filled the crawlway and made breathing difficult. A panic situation
resulted, to the point that "some of the members of the group lost
all
sense of direction, lost their shoes, knocked out their lights by bumping
their heads, spilled the contents of their packs, etc."
In the larger passage the smell was much less and they calmed down and
proceeded out without further incident.

Caver 10:6 June 1979 p 3-4.

Chuck Malone Personal Communication Feb. 12, 1980.
Analysis: The cavers discovered later that a lithium battery (2.8 volt,
D-size) in a single cell flashlight had overheated due to rapid discharge
when the terminal strip inside, by faulty design, shorted against the metal
base of the bulb socket. The overheated battery released sulfur dioxide
through a vent.
The really dangerour aspect of this situation, however, is the panic that
set in, causing an every-man-for-himself atmosphere. This is not to con-
demn these individuals, since I believe anyone will panic under the right cir-
cumstances. The lesson is obvious. Try to stay calm, communicate, and
choose a rational course of action.
Incident: Georgia, Climax Cave


********** May 31, 1979
On May 31, Frank Hutchison (30) and Chris Kerr (23) visited Climax
Cave in Georgia. Dark clouds were on the horizon but Hutchison is very
familiar with the cave and felt there was nothing to worry about.
Several hours after entering, in the north end of the cave they noted
several anomalous, rapid changes in air flow. This contributed to a decision
A65

---------- Page 36 ----------
to cut short the trip. As they reached a low area just before a long crawl
near the entrance there were signs that the water level had risen some six to
eight inches. The crawl is about one foot above this level and a sandy por-
tion showed signs of water flow. At a vertical crevice was a buildup of
white foam. Just beyond this the ceiling drops to a 15-inch sand crawl
about 20 inches in width. This leads to a short section of low ceiling called
the "Second Dig" since it occasionally has to be dug out. This was one
such occasion. At the Second Dig there was only about one-half to one inch
of air space above a pool of mud! After perhaps ten minutes of digging
Kerr was able to squeeze through. Hutchison, somewhat larger, could only
force his way with help from Kerr. They were soon out of the cave.
References: Editor "Activity Log" Speleonews August 1979 p 78.
Frank Hutchison Personal Communication March 1980.
Chris Kerr Personal Communication March 2, 1980.
Analysis: The air reversals appeared to coincide with the end of a storm.
While the silting of the entrance was of no great consequence, it appears
that a water rise could have been a problem in the new area toward which
they were headed. Hutchison's familiarity with the cave helped at the silt-in
since someone less familiar might have decided the silt-in was the wrong
way out and become lost. The lesson here is to have respect for the weather
in any cave even potentially affected by water.
Incident: West Virginia, Schoolhouse Cave
June 1979
A group of cavers entered Schoolhouse Cave, West Virginia, in June
1979. Mike Bruist was rappelling the first drop when his foot became wedg-
ed in a crevice in the wall. Before he could stop, he became inverted. Clip-
ping into the rope with a Jumar, he was able to free his foot. This left him
hanging from the Jumar which was attached to his chest harness. Unfor-
tunately the latter was not attached to his seat harness and began to con-
strict around his neck, choking him. Party members above quickly rigged a
second rope and another caver rappelled down to Bruist. Weight was taken
off the offending Jumar with additional ascenders and he was able to exit
the cave with no further problem.
Reference: Editorial "Cave Pearls" The Dripstone 9:2 Spring 1979 p 6.
Analysis: Such things happen. It is well to remember that chest harnesses,
even well made ones, are not suitable for suspending a body. All points of
potential suspension should be attached to a seat harness or chest-seat com-
bination.
Accident: Missouri, Indian Cave


********** June 23, 1979
On the afternoon of Saturday, June 23, Kenneth Sekola (22), Steve Mer-
cado (20) and Lynn Mercado (20) visited Indian Cave in Missouri. The first
two were soldiers stationed at Ft. Leonard Wood. They had explored in the
cave a few times previously. Lynn Mercado, the wife of Steve Mercado,
was a novice. They intended to stay only a couple of hours and carried only
flashlights with a couple of extra sets of batteries. They had no extra food,
A66
water or clothing for emergencies in the 58° F cave.
The group penetrated "a little faster and a little farther" than on
previous occasions. Soon they were resorting to arrows painted on the walls
for direction and found these to be ambiguous. It seemed they were lost.
Two of their flashlights became exhausted and finally the last was acciden-
tally dropped down a shallow pit. The men tied their belts together and
Sekola was lowered to retrieve the light. The belt belay failed and he tumbl-
ed 40 feet to the bottom. He was apparently unhurt but they decided to re-
main where they were until help arrived. Below, Sekola was able to find
some muddy water to drink. They felt rescue would not be too long in com-
ing since their car was at the entrance. Time dragged on. One day passed.
Then two.
Finally, in the early hours of Wednesday, they were found by rescuers
from the caving club at the University of Missouri at Rolla. They had been
in the cave some 84 hours.
They were treated at a local hospital for exposure and Sekola for a scalp
cut caused by a rock dislodged by rescuers.

Spelunkers" St. Louis Post Dispatch June 28, 1979.
Associated Press "Cave Rescue" The Mercury (Pottstown, Pa.)
June 29, 1979 p 16.
Analysis: Too many casual cavers feel that flashlights are adequate as
primary light sources. These were lucky as the cave is relatively warm and
that Sekola was not injured by his fall. The most important lesson here is
that a vehicle or vehicle with note left at the cave entrance is no guarantee
that rescuers will be sent immediately on your failure to return. Someone
should be informed of your objectives and instructed to notify authorities
when you fail to return at an appointed hour.
Accident: Tennessee, Cave near Pall Mall
May or June 1979
It is reported that a bank robber died in a shoot-out with police and the
FBI in a cave near Pall Mall, Tennessee, which he had been using as a
hideout.

Incident: New Mexico, Carlsbad Caverns


********** July 10, 1979
On July 10, in the early afternoon, Eugene Maroney (31), William Love-
joy (28), Dennis Mark (39) and David Kuczynski (28) took the commercial
tour at Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico. At 3:20 p.m., in the Lunchroom
area of the cave, the four men tried to push the potential of the cave. Pull-
ing out weapons, they seized Linda Phillips (24), a tour guide, and demand-
ed one million dollars and a plane to fly them to Brazil.
About 100 tourists were kept from leaving the cave via the elevators due
A67

---------- Page 37 ----------
to their fear of getting too close to the kidnappers. Despite the poor health
of some, all eventually were escorted out via the historic entrance by
rangers. Meanwhile, negotiations were conducted. At around 7:30 p.m. the
four surrendered after meeting with Ned Cantwell, publisher of the
Carlsbad (New Mexico) Current-Argus, and being promised to be charged
with only a misdemeanor, attempted false imprisonment.
Later, at their trial, District Court Judge Harry W. Fort rejected these
promises and the defendants stood trial for kidnapping.
References: Associated Press "Four Held in the Seizing of a Hostage at
Caverns" New York Times July 11, 1979 p B13; July 13, 1979 A14.
Analysis: Even commercial caves are not without hazard-don't be fooled
by false promises.
Incident: West Virginia, Hellhole Cave


********** July 20, 1979
On July 20, several groups of cavers, including a survey party and a push
team were in Hellhole Cave, Pendleton County, West Virginia.
As one caver was ascending the triple entrance pit, the sewn harness of
his foot Gibbs ripped apart but the foot was held on the rope by a chicken
loop. He continued out with no problem, along with the rest of his group.
Meanwhile, a thunderstorm developed, sending torrents of water down
the entrance drop. Several cavers had emerged just before it struck and
reported that one of their party was still below, safe at the bottom of the
drop but too tired to make it out. It was assumed that the still absent push
team would join this caver at the base of the drops. Nevertheless, prepara-
tions were made to descend and render aid once the rain stopped. One
caver finally volunteered to descend. The stranded caver was then able to
ascend under his own power. The push team eventually exited at around
midnight.
Reference: John Powers, et. al. "A Trip Report" Subterranean Sun 9:8
August 1979 p 3.
Analysis: The sewing of any harness for vertical work must be carefully
done and with synthetic thread. The chicken loop backup should always be
used. Better to be stranded at the bottom than part way up a flooded drop.
Accident: Tennessee, Wildman Cove Cave


********** August 11, 1979
Around noon on August 11, a group of cavers entered Wildman Cove
Cave in Tennessee. The entrance pit is 111 feet, part of this being a narrow
slot. Following several other cavers, Jonathon Hoag (14) began his rappel
descent. About halfway down his hair caught in his rappel rack, stopping
him with his head pinned against the rack.
Those below soon ascertained the problem, a knife was tied to the rope
and Hoag pulled it up. While cutting himself free, he also cut his scalp,
causing much pain and bleeding. Hoag was able to continue the rappel to
the bottom where one of the other cavers, a paramedic, stopped the flow of
blood and bandaged the wound. With assistance from other cavers, Hoag
A68
was able to ascend out. His wound received further treatment at a nearby
hospital.
Reference: John Hoffelt NSS Accident Report Undated.
Analysis: Hoag had long hair, not tied back, and was reportedly doing a
quick rappel. He had been warned, but had not previously caught his hair
in a rack and so was not prepared. Especially in a narrow pit such as this,
clothes, hair, breasts, etc. can come against the rack and be caught. One
must be aware.
Accident: Tennessee, Worley's Cave


********** August 24, 1979
On Friday, August 24, at 11 a.m., Randall Gilmore (16) and Don Simcox
(16) entered Worley's Cave near Bluff City, Tennessee. They soon became
lost.
At 3:30 p.m. their brothers reported them missing to the Sullivan County
Sheriff's Department. A search team from the Bluff City Volunteer Fire
Department found the lost cavers at 7:10 p.m.
References: Associated Press "Ordeal Ends" The Huntsville Times
August 26, 1979 p 16.
Editor "Rescue" Hunstville Grotto Newsletter 20:9 September 1979.
Analysis: There is insufficient information for analysis, but one can suspect
the cavers were poorly equipped. Poor lights probably contributed to their
getting lost. A photo showed them with no hard hats.
Accident: California, Ice Cave
August 1979
A Youth Conservation Corps (YCC) group was on an environmental
outing and was visiting an ice cave at Laltonda Wells near Medicine Lake
north of Redding, California. Twenty youths had been assisted into the
cave when Bob Hess (22), a "recreation leader" made his descent using a
different method from the others. Unfortunately, his "rope failed" and he
fell 32 feet.
This is an isolated site. After the accident, the group contacted the Orr
Mountain Lookout by radio. The lookout phoned the Goosenest Ranger
Station (USFS) and a fire-fighting tanker and crew were dispatched. The
Butte Valley ambulance was also called. The tanker crew included three
EMT's who descended to the victim and determined that his injuries
wouldn't allow transportation by ambulance over the rough roads. A call
was made for the only available helicopter, one operated by the California
Division of Forestry, out of Bieber, California. Forest Service and YCC
crews meanwhile labored to prepare a landing site. The ambulance arrived
and its equipment was helpful in removing Hess from the cave. The litter
had to be manuevered over several overhangs on the wall of the pit. Hess
was taken to a Klamath Falls, Oregon hospital and treated for a broken leg,
internal injuries and shock.

Analysis: Too little information available for comment. Luckily, it was an
organized outing with good communications and resources.
Accident: Indiana, Wildcat Cave
September 1979
At around 10 p.m., Bob Hoffmeyer, Doug Cherry, Willis Cherry and
Bill Goshen (28) entered Wildcat Cave near Valeene, Orange County, In-
diana. They rappelled the drop in the entrance room and explored a maze
of wet passage until about 3 a.m. They returned to the pit and at 4 a.m.
began to ascend. Cherry went up first, followed by Goshen. After ascen-
ding for 10 to 12 minutes, Goshen reached the upper lip but complained of
fatigue and was suffering cramps in his hands. Even with Cherry's help he
couldn't get over the lip. Goshen rested for 15 minutes but still couldn't get
over the lip. He was told to descend. He complained of hand cramps and
dizziness and in 20 minutes had made it only halfway down. Exhausted, he
hung there for a while then continued. He got five feet further down, then
began to pass out. Cherry was told to go for help by those below and
Goshen hung, semi-conscious, where he was.
A land owner, State Trooper, Conservation Officer and County Sheriff
were brought back in an hour and a half. A line was passed down to
Goshen and he clipped it to his chest harness. He was then pulled up to a
natural bridge that divides the pit. From there he was able to make his way
out of the cave, exiting at 7:30 p.m.
Reference: Bob Hoffmeyer "Wildcat Rescue" CIG Newsletter
Oct.-Nov. 1979 p 68.
Analysis: An unfortunate situation perhaps the result of caving into the
night after putting in a full day at other things.
Accident: Alabama, Natural Well
September 1979
Four cavers entered Natural Well, Alabama, on the afternoon of
September 1. Two were experienced and two had been caving only six mon-
ths with "some" experience in vertical caves. All were about 25 years old.
They had not slept since driving down from Indiana the previous night and
had no food with them. Their dress was jeans and T-shirts with one extra
dry shirt.
At 4:30 p.m. they arrived at the entrance pit, rigged it, and rappelled in.
This pit is 180 feet with two normally dry inlet streams. Below is 57° F cave
with large horizontal passage that never floods.
The trip was basically a bop of the pit entrance, and at 6 p.m. the first of
the cavers, Brian Finnigan, started out. Shortly before 6:30 a thunderstorm
broke, yielding intense rain. A second caver, Jim Gaskell, got out but the
water flow was by then so great that the others, Mark Kiselke (25) and
George Cesnik (25), could not ascend. They took refuge on a protected
ledge about 12 feet off the floor. The flow continued to increase, carrying
large rocks and debris into the pit. Communication with those below was
impossible so Finnigan and Gaskell went to the nearest house and called for
help.
A70
They called the emergency phone number which resulted in contact with
the Huntsville Police State Park Rangers, Madison County Rescue Squad
and the EMSI Ambulance Service. MCRS contacted the Huntsville Cave
Rescue Unit at 7:15 p.m. Heavy rain continued. Help began to arrive at
7:30. Two teams began diverting the streams flowing into the pit and wet-
suits and warm clothes were called for.
By 9:30 p.m. the water flow had decreased such that Carl Craig descend-
ed without a wetsuit. He carried a space blanket for the trapped cavers and
was able to signal that all was OK. By 10 p.m. the water flow was further
reduced and Craig signalled that one man was ready to be hoisted. As this
was done a National Guard field telephone was lowered. This hastened the
completion of the rescue and all were out by 10:30 p.m.

Huntsville Times September 2, 1979 p 67.

Huntsville Grotto Newsletter 20:10 October 1979 p 82.
Analysis: The cavers were perhaps prepared for normal conditions.
However, in any cave even potentially subject to flooding, one must be
aware of local weather conditions. If thunderstorm conditions are forecast,
the trip should be cancelled.
Accident: Texas, Jacob's Well


********** September 9, 1979
Shortly after midnight on September 9, Kent Maupin (20) and Mark
Brashier (20) and a few others made a dive into Jacob's Well, near Wimber-
ly, Texas. Maupin was an experienced diver-an assistant instructor and
part-time employee at a dive shop.
The entrance to the Well is a small crevice in the bottom of Cypress
Creek. For some distance the clear waters and spaciousness provide for safe
diving. A point is reached, however, beyond which few had penetrated.
This squeeze was rumored to lead to a vast room and had previously claim-
ed the lives of four divers. Maupin had spoken of making this penetration
but on September 9 had not done the planning nor gotten any specialized
equipment for such-no backup lights, no safety line.
At the squeeze Maupin and Brashier apparently decided on impulse to go
for it. In turn each removed his tank and backed into the crevice, pulling
his air supply after him. Another diver, Joe Moye, saw this and flashed his
light to get their attention, with no effect.
Moye's aluminum tank held more air than the steel tanks of Maupin and
Brashier and with their deeper exploration, their air consumption would be
greater. With his own air supply running low, Moye finally had to leave.
He banged hopefully on his tank with his knife, but no response came. He
left his light shining at the squeeze and retreated. Just after he reached the
surface, the clear water became silty-an impenetrable brown. Whatever
the reason, it meant the lost divers would not be coming out.
The police were called and the Hays County volunteer body-recovery
unit put together a team of four divers. They arrived at the Well before
dawn. The other members of the original diving party had gone back in
with no success but one diver, in the course of two ninety minute dives,
A71

---------- Page 39 ----------
claimed to have seen the bodies buried in a pile of gravel. Two divers went
down but failed to see any bodies, only that the squeeze was almost closed
with gravel. It was decided to get more divers.
At 10 a.m. on the 10th of September two divers went down and tried to
move gravel with trowels to make a passable space, but failed. Don Dibble,
the leader of the rescue team, then descended with another diver to assess
the situation. Using a safety line and with ten minutes of air left, he
cautiously entered the squeeze. Observing with his light it seemed obvious
that the gravel bed would have to be removed before body recovery would
be feasible. At that point Dibble himself was suddenly trapped by a gravel
slide. Both arms were pinned-he could neither jerk on the safety line nor
bang on his tank. He frantically tried to release himself and in a short time
was out of air. As he prepared to die, his body automatically went into its
final spasms and, amazingly, he lurched free. However, when given the
regulator of the spare tank he inserted the mouthpiece and inhaled with
sufficient force that he swallowed air as well. He tried to belch but
couldn't. As he surfaced, the air expanded and caused extreme pain. He
suffered a ruptured stomach wall and subsequent peritonitis-he was in-
itially diagnosed as suffering from an embolism and it was sometime later
before his true condition was realized from X-rays.
Another expert was called in and also was of the opinion that the gravel
would have to be removed. A professional diving company was contracted.
After a week of removing gravel with a suction device, a worker was pinned
by a slide. Another diver was sent down and the trapped man was safely
released. Two more days of dredging went on and a passage was opened
enough to allow a videotape camera on a broom handle to be thrust
through. It showed a "low, broad, vaulted room" of uncertain size.
Replays of the tape allowed a glimpse of a tank valve and regulator
mouthpiece to be identified.
A day later, with more gravel cleared away, a diver made it almost to the
end of the squeeze passage. The floor dropped off into the chamber seen on
the camera. No scuba gear and no bodies were seen, though it was possible
they were above the observer since the ceiling could not be seen. To actually
enter the room would require the removal of two large boulders.
At that point operations were suspended while the funding was clarified.
Two days later the crew was back at work with their previous efforts
nullified by a refill of gravel. It soon became obvious that their efforts were
futile. A second professional opinion was the same-call off the body
recovery. The recovery efforts had taken 12 days. Three months later a bar-
rier was constructed, sealing off the Well at the 75 foot level.

Analysis: Cave diving properly conducted is very dangerous. To cave dive
without planning and proper equipment would seem to be insanity or ex-
treme stupidity. What is it, then, that seizes normally sane, intelligent
A72
people and leads them into situations such as this?
The involved recovery operations in this double fatality point out a
blindness common among adventurous people. It is often stated by those
undertaking exceptionally hazardous and perhaps foolhardy enterprises
that no one should come for them if they fail to return or that no one
should worry about recovery of their body if they are killed. Those making
such a statement apparently feel better about their activities since it is then
only their lives placed in jeopardy. This is rank foolishness. Society places a
great value on human life and even on the human body and insists upon go-
ing to great expense and even the endangering of other lives to recover one
of its own, even if already dead.
Accident: Missouri, Perkins Cave
September
On Thursday, September 20 at about 9:30 p.m., Dale Campbell
Randy Welch (18) entered Perkins Cave near Montreal, Missouri for a cou-
ple of hours of exploration. After 2 1/2 hours they were about a half mile in-
to the maze cave when their only flashlight began to fail. They started out
but after another half hour the dimming flashlight failed completely. They
tried to continue with cigarette lighters but these also failed and they were
left in the dark. Occasionally they would sleep or move about in an attempt
to keep warm. Time passed. The cavers began to lose hope.
Meanwhile, the fall meeting of the Middle-Mississippi Valley Region of
the NSS was going on not far away. Three cavers, desiring an interesting
cave to explore were directed to Perkins Cave. On Sunday, they went to the
cave and were exploring when their talking was heard by the lost cavers
who yelled to attract their attention. The rescuers gave the lost cavers some
food and water and led them out. It was reported that others had searched
part of the cave for the lost boys earlier using dogs.

Editor "Rescue, an unexpected feature of cave explorer convention"
The Eldon Advertiser October 4, 1979 p 7.
Analysis: If authorities did search the cave unsuccessfully, the boys were
probably lost for good except for their chance meeting with cavers. Cavers
need to work on county authorities in cave areas to get them to call on
cavers to help in cave accidents. The boys, so poorly equipped, are another
example of cavers not involved with organized caving undertaking explora-
tion in a way no organized caver would.
Incident: West Virginia, Organ Cave


********** October 27, 1979
On October 27, three cavers were on a trip to Organ Cave, West Virginia
as part of a dye tracing project. After much arduous caving. thev were on
the way out. As they neared the commerical trail, Russ Rhoads (38) stepped
up on a medium sized piece of breakdown and at that moment suffered

---------- Page 40 ----------
a ruptured achilles tendon. This caused him to collapse, falling backward
to the ground. With some assistance he made it out of the cave. The rup-
tured tendon required an operation, physical therapy, and several month's
convalescence.
References: R. Healey "Accident" D.C. Speleograph
November 1979 p 15.
R. Rhoades Personal Communication February 26, 1980.
Analysis: The weak tendon was judged to be an inherited trait. Rhoads
believes it was aggravated by extensive running in poor running shoes in the
preceeding months. It was therefore only coincidental that the injury oc-
curred in a cave.
Accident: Indiana, Hoosier National Forest
Swallowhole Cave


********** November 3, 1979
On November 3, Randy Jackson (22), Dave Black and Dan Dible were
exploring and mapping in Hoosier National Forest Swallowhole Cave in
southern Indiana. The group had been going for some seven hours and was
taking a break to change carbide. Jackson fired up his lamp, but the bot-
tom caught fire from gas leakage. Thinking he had dropped the gasket into
his dump bag, he blew out the fire, then opened the bag and shined his light
in. There was a flash of flame as acetylene and air in the bag exploded.
Jackson experienced a sharp burning pain in his eyes. Even after several
minutes with his eyes closed, it was extremely painful to move either eye. It
became obvious that the trip out would be difficult. They began the long
crawl, with Jackson opening one eye occasionally to get direction. A ten
foot rappel was done without much problem. At a traverse over a 15-foot
pit, he had some difficulty since one-eyed vision gives little depth percep-
tion. The other two guided him vocally. More crawlway and the climb out
the 40-foot entrance pit were done without incident.
At Bloomington Hospital a piece of carbide was removed from
Jackson's right eye leaving a 3-mm burn scar and slightly impaired vision.
The eye later recovered completely.
Reference: Randy Jackson Personal Communications January 1980;
February 25, 1980.
Analysis: Acetylene from "spent" carbide will mix with air in any closed
space, dump bag, cave pack, etc., to form an explosive mixture. Such ex-
plosions are usually minor in the force they generate and are a relatively
common occurrence. In this case, it had serious consequences. Beware.
Accident: California, Santa Cruz Island Sea Cave


********** December 2, 1979
At about noon on Sunday, December 2, Tom Campbell, Cindy Camp-
bell (27) and Dr. Bruce Smith (30) decided to go scuba diving to hunt
lobsters in a partially submerged cave. Leaving Campbell's 27-foot boat
they entered the cave. They were about 100 yards in when they stirred up
enough silt to obscure their vision. Becoming uncertain about the direction
out, they decided to wait. About four hours later they realized they might
A74
not have enough air left to make it out, so Tom Campbell took a tank from
one of the others and headed out. The other two braced themselves against
a sloping rock in an air space and kept out of the water as much as possible.
Campbell found the exit at about 6 p.m. but suffered ear trouble and diz-
ziness and could not find his way back. He was overheard talking to a
friend on radio by the Coast Guard and a Ventura County Sheriff's
Department Searcn and Rescue Diving Team was sent off at about 8 p.m.
At midnight they were at the scene and were guided to the cave by Camp-
bell. The other two were found in good shape and were out of the cave by
3:30 a.m. Monday, having been trapped for about 14 hours.
Reference: John Kendall "Two Divers Trapped 14 Hours" Los Angeles
Times December 4, 1979 Pt 1, p 3.
Analysis: The divers were not prepared for underwater caving. They used
no safety lines and had only flashlights. If the cave had been more complex,
Campbell might not have gotten out. If they had had powerful lights, the
silt might not have trapped them.
Accident: Tennessee, Cedar Creek Cave


********** December 2, 1979
On Sunday, December 2, a group of cavers were in Cedar Creek Cave
near Greenville, Tennessee. Beyond the Duckunder, a 200-foot water crawl
with six inches of air space, Francis Murphy suffered a broken leg. The
evacuation reportedly took six hours.
Reference: Editorial COG Squeaks October 1979.
Analysis: Too little information.
Accident: Tennessee, Rattling Cave


********** December 22, 1979
At about 11 a.m. on Saturday, December 22, Arthur Cathers (26),
William Copeland (27) and Jean Copeland (27) entered Rattling Cave near
Newport, Tennessee. They explored for a while and then went back to the
135-foot entrance drop to leave. They found their rope hung up on a ledge,
out of reach, and they could not climb up to get it. They sat down and
waited, eating some fudge they had with them.
The mother of one of the cavers reported them overdue to the Newport
Police Department. Their car was found outside the entrance and they were
rescued at about 8 p.m. on Sunday. They had spent some 33 hours in the
cave.
Reference: Associated Press "Three Cave Explorers Spend 33 Hours
Awaiting Rescue" The Huntsville Times December 24, 1979.
Analysis: It sounds like someone found the rope rigged in the cave, pulled
it up and then threw it back whereupon it hung up on a ledge above the
floor.

STATISTICAL SUMMARY
The following is a tabular breakdown of accidents and incidents using
categories traditional to previous ACA issues. Obviously the date would be
more revealing if statistics on the activity of caving itself were included. In
judging the cause of an accident it is inevitable that my own views on such
things will be expressed. For instance, the category of "inexperience" has
almost no place in my scheme of causes yet in previous ACA's was a major
"cause" of accidents.
It is also difficult to precisely draw the line between accident and inci-
dent. Moreover, it must be admitted that every year accidents go
unreported, both in and out of the organized caving scene. Finally, a single
entrapment could include a number of victims and thus equal a number of
injury-type accidents, throwing off a statistical sampling which is already
too small.
Please view these statistics in light of the above-mentioned limitations.
